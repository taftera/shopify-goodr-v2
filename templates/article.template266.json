Let’s finish this message as soon as possible because it’s cold as f*ck. I WOULD say it’s cold enough to freeze your d*ck off, but I don’t have a d*ck. Don’t believe me? Look it up. Male flamingos, like many male birds, don’t have penises. We have cloaca, like female birds. It’s true. And it’s cold enough to freeze your f***ing cloaca off.<\/p>\n<p>I’m here to promote our sunglasses for the annual Antarctica 26.2 Mile Running Race. No, that’s not a joke. ‍This is the 16th year. The registration fee is $17,900. Competitors take a private jet from Punta Arenas, Chile to Union Glacier, Antarctica (the interior). The altitude is 700 meters. The windchill temperature is -20C. There will be snowmobile support and medical aid stations. There will not be crowds, because this is a frozen hellscape. If you die, you get a medal that says “Dying is fun?”<\/p>\n<p>\nSpeaking of death, I want to kill a nasty rumor. You might have heard the gossip that I’ve been stuck in Antarctica for the entire year, because goodr employees were pissed off at me <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/carls-got-a-candy-heart-on-origin-story\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">for pulling terrible Valentine's Day pranks <\/span><\/a> and paid off my pilot to strand me here, meaning I just PRETENDED to go to <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/tokyo-2021-origin-story\">Tokyo<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/la-2021-origin-story\">Los Angeles<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/la-2021-origin-story\">Boston<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/london-2021-origin-story\">London<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/berlin-2021-origin-story\">Berlin,<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/chicago-2021-origin-story\">Chicago<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/new-york-city-2021-origin-story\">New York<\/a>\nRidiculous. Just ridiculous. Don’t believe it!!!\n<\/p><p>\nWhat the hell would I even do in Antarctica for a year? Kayak with whales, climb Mt. Vinson, hang with emperor penguins, witness Blood Falls, scuba dive, visit a scientific research station, explore the active volcano at Deception Island, send a postcard from Port Lockroy, and drink vodka at the southernmost bar in the world, Vernadsky Research Base? Yeah, right. Whatever you say.\n<\/p><p>\nI WILL HAVE MY REVENGE.\n<\/p><p>\nCarl<\/p>",
