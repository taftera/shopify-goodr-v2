Their mission is to bridge the disparity gap of BIPOC representation in the running community, raise awareness, empower, educate, and inspire by creating a supportive platform and establishing partnerships in LA and surrounding communities. Since goodr's mission is to give you permission to be unabashedly yourself...unless you're an asshole, this is a match made in heaven! (Shhh, don't tell them we party in hell.) Keep crushing it, Angel City Elite athletes!<\/p>",

They told me to open my eyes so they could see if anything was wrong. I was scared but I slowly opened my eyes and saw about 10 firefighters staring at me.. Turns out nothing was wrong with my eye.
