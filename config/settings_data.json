Neon is a retro trend that we hope never goes away. Thanks to goodr, you can neonify your face! In -- you guessed it! -- the form of polarized sunglasses! Why? Well, we could tell you… but it’s going to cost you the three minutes and 35 seconds it takes to read this article. Or less, if you’re a speed reader. If you are a speed reader, there will be a quiz at the end because we’re pretty sure anyone who claims to read that fast isn’t actually comprehending anything.<\/p><p>Neon colors are even cooler when you start digging deeper into their origins. Some of the first known observations of “neon” can be traced back to scientists observing bioluminescent organisms. In the 16th century, in Mexico, a scientist noticed a tree where the water around it had an electric-blue glow. The tree is known as kidney wood. This is now one of goodr CEO Carl the Flamingo’s, favorite vacation spots, home of the great flamingo rave of 1988. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Neon continued to develop in the mid 1880s when Heinrich Geissler, a German glassblower and physicist sealed glass tubes with two electrodes creating an electric current to make the gases within glow. What kind of gases? Flamingo farts of course! Nah, we don’t really know-- we make sunglasses not neon signs, but we definitely are big fans of neon signs.<\/p>",

These aren’t the cheesy freebies that you get at the bar (you know, when you’re lucky enough to be there during that one hour of a good booze promo). goodr sunglasses are made with functionality in mind, with their signature, no slip, no bounce, and all polarized amazingness.<\/p>\n<p>Oh HECK yes we said POLARIZED! Let’s talk about what it means to be polarized. “Polarized” is certainly a buzz word in the sunglass world. It’s often used to sound techy and an excuse to jack the price tag up. We hate to break it to you, but that’s all garbage marketing. You really can have legit polarized sunglasses for $25 to $35 dollars. Polarized sunglasses reduce glare-causing reflections found on flat surfaces. The sun blasts the light in all directions, but when it hits a flat surface it bounces back in a more uniform path. This typically horizontal rechanneling of light intensifies the light in a way that annoys our eyes, causing glare, and reducing visibility. This is simply fixed with a special filter that blocks intense reflected light. In other words, hello polarized lenses! The result, crisper visibility and decreased eye strain when in bright light. Hot damn! Bright sunglasses that help your eyes in bright light! Sounds like you really can have your cake and eat it too.<\/p>\n<p>BUT SERIOUSLY, ENOUGH BREAKING IT DOWN ALREADY.

              "text": "<p>The best <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/collections\/golf-sunglasses\">golf sunglasses<\/a> have a variety of benefits. With the right lens tint they can help you read greens better, detect contours, or even help make it easier for you to see your ball in the air and on the ground. In the rough again? Even better!<\/p>\n<p>Also, news alert: sunglasses protect you from...the sun!! That’s right -- another major benefit to wearing proper eyewear while golfing has to do with eye fatigue. A smart player (like you!) will do whatever they can to help protect their peepers from the sun’s harmful UV rays. For the record, UV rays are the ADHD rays of the family (no offense, Cameron, it was just the easiest way to describe it to non-science people --- that’s one of our employee’s nephews who has ADHD, and we know it’s not a laughing matter). They bounce around in every which way. Especially near water, sand, and even on grass, which, if you didn’t know, are all things on a golf course. They blast through clouds with the same ease you blasted through the OB marker when you shanked it on hole 6. Glare acts in the same way. This means that even when it’s overcast, great golfing sunglasses with proper UV protection and polarized lenses are a major asset for your eyes, and your game.<\/p>\n<p>We could nerd out on the lens tech here for a hundred paragraphs, but this is what you need to know in a nutshell:<\/p>\n<p>1. goodr golf sunglasses have a polarized layer and a UV400 layer within the lens.<\/p>\n<p>2. The <strong>polarized lenses<\/strong> works to filter the intensified horizontal light that bounces off of flat surfaces and redirect it to the vertical plane.<\/p>\n<p>3. Lens technology: The UV400 layer blocks 99%-100% of both UVA and UVB light, yes, actual electromagnetic radiation that busts through the ozone layer.<\/p>\n<p>4. It takes a lot of work for your pupils to continually adjust to these changing light conditions. They’re constantly contracting and dilating. This results in migraines and headaches. You can help your peepers save some energy simply by wearing proper (ahem… GOODR) sunglasses while you recreate outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>5. STAY TUNED to learn about <strong>Flamingo Eye™ Technology<\/strong>. It will blow your mind! ...Keep reading...<\/p>\n<p>So. Why look to goodr when you're searching for the best glasses for golf, besides the fact that we know how to write an informational article that actually makes you laugh? We have three basic reasons, all of which relate back to goodr’s four Fs: Fun. Fashionable. Functional. Fffordable. We kicked the “A” out of “affordable.” Four Fs is better than three Fs and an A, wouldn’t ya say? Rolls off the tongue better, or-- in our Flamingo CEO Carl’s case-- the beak. <\/p>\n<p>Henceforth, in this article, we’re gonna capitalize our four Fs so you don’t forget (there will be a quiz).<\/p>",

You can surely expect goodr’s famous no slip, no bounce, all polarized standards. Let’s face it, glare can ruin your day. Polarization to the rescue! Wearing sunglasses relieves golfers’ eyes from intense sunlight. Getting the ball airborne and headed in the right direction is almost impossible if you can’t visually judge the distance to the hole. This is important because, ummmmm... correct us if we’re wrong....gauging how far a shot needs to go is pretty much the whole game of golf? Drive that shit with confidence because you can actually see where you’re sending it. <\/p>\n<p>On top of exceptional UV and polarized protection, goodr has dubbed our golf-specific lens technology: Flamingo Eye™. All the HD contrast and performance without any of the self-importance. The lenses used within our golf line are truly made with gophers on the brain. Did we say gophers?

Whether it’s double, triple, or flamingo five, the more flamingos the better the party. WARNING: if playing with real flamingos, be sure to keep an eye on them.

The OGs, which are inspired by a super classic frame style that originated in the 50s, are goodr’s signature style. The BFGs, which properly stands for Big F*cking Goodrs, as they are a larger model with enhanced silicon inserts. A great option if your melon is a little large or if you just like more coverage. Lastly, there are the ever-so-glamorous, The Runways, a sleek cateye shape with some extra grip. These beauties will surely make you look and feel like a model while you golf. Each style comes in its own version of argyle-printed, and flamingo-printed frames, in addition to an array of lovely solid color options. With so many choices at the best possible price, we wish you luck picking your favorite. It’s harder than you think.<\/p>",

Chad ruins the day by having a few too many during the front 9. Insert eyeroll emoji.) Now, we knew what “shanking it” was, but here’s some research we did about the physics of a shank:  a shank happens when the golfer hits the golf ball on the innermost portion of the clubface, so far toward the heel that the golf ball is contacted by the rounded hosel. Most commonly, a shank results in a ball that shoots out to the right (for a right-hander) at a severe angle. Then you yell “Shanked it!” so at least people are aware that you know you suck. Awareness is the first step. It is at this moment that a ball to the eye is far too probable. Smart choice to wear goodrs old chap! Your eyes are safe, thank goodness. Oh no! Your lenses got effed in the process? No worries, even though you only forked over $25 bones for these puppies, goodr has a stellar customer service team that would love to take care of you if you give ‘em a good story (even better if you add a dog pic)!

It was first used as a color name in the late 17th century. Whereas most shades of pink fall within red and magenta, with a slightly bluish tint, pink can also lean towards orange producing more of a salmon color. Another acceptable name for pink is rose, also inspired by the flower. We prefer rosé, which, not-so-coincidentally, is also pink. <\/p>\n<p>For all you symbol-seekers out there, the color pink is known to represent charm, calmness, love, and optimism. It is the sweet side of red. You know, not the angry, red planet, bloody, God of War side. Pink is a lovely color from hue to symbolism, therefore making it the best color to accessorize with. And the best type of accessory? Sunglasses. Ob.

We get this question a lot at goodr, because, <i>dayummmmm<\/i> our CEO has nice feathers. Compliment his feathers and hand him a ring of fresh shrimp cocktail with a stiff piña colada and he’ll love you forever. In all honesty though, it wouldn’t be fair if we didn’t admit that Carl’s stunning feathers have inspired many pink goodr sunglasses. They’re that pretty. Okay, so why pink? Well, flamingos are actually born with white or gray feathers. It is what they eat that gives them their pink glow. (A true case of “you are what you eat”... that’s gotta be tough…) Shrimp-like crustaceans have a natural pink dye which over time changes the feather color. When flamingos are malnourished, typically when in captivity, you can tell by their color (according to National Geographic, our go-to source for random flamingo facts, second only to anything David Attenborough has done on flamingos!). Clearly then, Carl is a well fed flamingo!<\/p>\n<p><\/p>",

The OG line falls more in the gender neutral territory when it comes to sizing, however, we realize that not all skulls are the same size. Generally, male skulls are heavier, the bone is thicker, and the areas where the muscles attach are more defined than in females. The forehead, eyes and jaw, are also differntiating characteristics between men and women when it comes to determining the sex of a skull. With that, we developed the BFGs, or Big F*cking Goodrs. With wider frames, longer arms, and bigger lenses than our OGs, these babies are designed to complement and fit humans with larger melons or those looking for more coverage. We can’t forget fashion rule #32 when talking about the BFGs: bigger really is better. <\/p>",

It doesn’t get much more functional than that.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“Holllddd uppp… did you say polarized?! But aren’t goodr’s price points like $25 and $35 dollars? How can you have polarized sunglasses for that price?” This is actually a great question. Polarized sunglasses are sunglasses that have lenses with a specific polarized filter. And no! It’s not just a coating, it is an actual physical layer within the lens. Let’s break it down real smooth:<\/p>\n<p>The sun shines.The sun’s light scatters!The sun’s light reflects off of flat surfaces in an intense horizontal path causing glare, or electromagnetic vibration.The glare annoys you and makes it harder to see.You put on goodrs!The polarization filters the reflected light into the vertical frame, meaning that the glare is cut down, your eyes can rest, everything looks crisper.<\/p>\n<p>Let’s look deeper at #6, “your eyes can rest.” This is important because eye fatigue is a direct trigger for headaches and migraines… which nobody has time for. What causes this eye fatigue? Your pupils are constantly expanding and contracting while they adjust to a changing angle and intensity of light. That shit gets exhausting.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Sunglasses should probably just be considered medical devices. Think about it for a sec… we put sunscreen on when we go to the beach, it’s equally important to protect your eyes. Yeah, go ahead and put sunscreen on your peepers, that’ll be a fun experiment! To protect our eyes further from the sun, goodr sunglasses have UV400 protection. This isn’t a lens coating, it’s another layer in the lens. Freaking magic right??! UV400 protection blocks 99%-100% of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet light, electromagnetic radiation bustin’ through the ozone layer no matter what time of year it is. This light comes down in UVA and UVB rays, and guess what? goodr sunglasses block it all! ALL HAIL FUNCTIONALITY!<\/p>",

It’s then that he slides out onto a narrow gap between two rocks and leans into the gale force winds shredding over the mountain. The wind almost rips his SigEp T-shirt from his body. He looks like one of those people in the wind chambers that aerialists and skydivers train in. Nonetheless, I decide that I am woman enough to solider on through my own march south to the summit of Sherman. I make it several hundred yards further when a gust that must be over 80 mph catches my dog off guard, picks him up, and moves him a foot closer to the edge. The same gust knocks me to my knees.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>I’ve been skydiving. During the freefall the winds pulls your cheeks from your face and they flap from your cheekbones like a strange rubber Halloween mask. The wind is shoved back into your throat with such force during the freefall that it makes breathing difficult.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That’s what this wind was doing. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>But I wasn’t skydiving.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I’m about 200 yards from the summit. But between the large, flat summit and my current crouch behind a boulder is a narrow ridge. It can’t be more than 50 yards long, but it’s only five feet wide. I’m not trying Wicked Witch of the West off the ridge of this peak today. So I do it, I turn around. I let General Sherman beat me.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the trail reminds us how piss-poor, weak, and insignificant we really are. And that’s a good thing to remember. So I decide that running to 13,900 feet and learning a valuable lesson deserves a trail beer. Cheers.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><em>By Kate Waller<\/em><\/p>",

While Carl already knew a few things about the track star, he really wanted to get the nitty-gritty details. He put down that piña colada and rattled off his deepest and most thought-provoking questions— only to pick it up a few more times during the conversation, until by the last question he was slurping the end of his second colada, rather rudely, while poor Alexi continued to speak. Oh, Carl.<\/p>\n<p>1 P.M., ON A TUESDAY:<\/p>\n<p><strong>CARL: Do you want a piña colada? No? Okay, no problem, I’m going to have one. So, Alexi, I see you like to run…. Why running?  Why not curling, the most honorable Olympic sport??<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>ALEXI: What I love about running is that at the end of the day, it’s not about me vs. she— it’s about me vs. me. While I love competition, ultimately the biggest competition in distance running is your own pain tolerance. It becomes a test of willpower, and to me, that is the most thrilling competition of all; to see how far I can push myself. Of course, I’ve always wanted to try curling…. maybe someday!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>CARL: Who would win in a race: giant octopus or giant squid? My money is on the Kraken.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>ALEXI: In a race to a frying pan and then to my belly, the squid and the octopus would tie. In an actual foot race, the octopus, because their legs are longer!!<\/p>",

So I’ll go with rosé mile.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CARL: Hmm, gettin’ scientific. I like it. I hear you just moved to SoCal. Where is your favorite place to run?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>ALEXI: My favorite thing about my favorite running trails isn’t necessarily the trail itself, but the memories associated with it. I have favorite places to run all over the world: the Amazon Loop in Eugene, where I really grew into an elite athlete; the small track in Karpenisi, Greece, where I prepared for the 2016 Olympics; the list goes on. My favorite thing about LA, which I’ve just moved, is the cornucopia of new trails where I will surely create new memories. I’ve already begun exploring the trails in the Santa Monica Mountains and in Malibu Creek State Park– I am so excited to make these new trails my home.<\/p>",

I mean, the kind of thing that makes your friends and family look at you and say, “What the f*%$ is wrong with you?” We do. Constantly. That’s what brought us back into the desert for the second year in a row to make the trek from Santa Monica to Las Vegas on foot as part of The Speed Project. We had some familiar faces, as well as some newcomers who are just as bonkers to attempt this journey.<\/p>\n<p>For those who weren’t around for our first crack at this truly absurd race, here is the rundown: In 2014, Nils Arend and 5 friends wanted to attempt the irrational. They set out on a 340-mile quest starting at the Santa Monica Pier, traveling across busy highways and rugged dirt roads, tagging each other out mile after mile until they made it to the infamous Welcome to Las Vegas sign. No rules. No set course. No medals at the finish. Just a hunger to see if they could. The desire for a challenge was infectious, and each year new teams toe the 4 am start line-- knowing they will not see that famed sign for close to 2 days. This year’s winners did the trip in 31 hours 15 minutes.<\/p>",

We are not the winners.<\/p>\n<p>Ours is a story 13 people, 8 runners, and 5 crew members, who are recklessly committed to fun. We drank fireball out of the bottle. We ate fluffernutters as thick as our trembling quads. We competed to see who could poop the most times. We drank beer by the dozen.<\/p>\n<p>We were not the winners.<\/p>\n<p>But, we are a group of coworkers who thoroughly enjoy spending time together, love to run, and had just launched a new line of limited edition glasses centered around everyone’s favorite city of sin. So into the desert we went; stocked to the ceiling with avocados, Fritos, peanut butter, bananas, and butt wipes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We set out with only 3 rules for our 340-mile trip:<\/strong><br>1. Be safe.<br>2. Have fun.<br>3. No pooping in the RV.<\/p>\n<p>While there are technically no rules to this race, the rules in our RV were ironclad, none more so than the 3rd. Have you ever pumped an RV? Me neither, and I don’t have any interest in changing that fact.<\/p>\n<p>So, this goodr crew gathered in Santa Monica at 4 a.m., watching our fastest runner take off down Ocean, and given that it’s L.A., we barely beat him to the first exchange: 5:52 pace. He tagged our second runner in, and she started with a 5:52 pace as if she isn’t a 4-hour marathoner. The open road reminded her very quickly. And that’s how it went. Fast and slow, road and trail runners alike, tagged in and out as we made our way through Los Angeles, out into the Valley, then disappearing into the desert.<\/p>\n<p>In a race with no rules, we were able to decide our plan of attack. Armed with only a spiral bound book of the segments the original crew had broken down, we headed towards Death Valley ready to tackle the distance 6 miles at a time. Then 3 miles at a time. Then 2. Then down to 1. <\/p>\n<p>I cannot tell you, even as a marathoner surrounded by a team of ultra runners, how far a mile can feel when you jump out of the sanctuary of your RV, tag in, and then watch the RV drive past you and into the distance.<\/p>",

The movie was expected to be the be-all, end-all depiction of the nitty-gritty world of the 1970s and 80s bike culture, and Dirk, the epitome of bad boy bikers of the golden days, was a role that would surely make or break Mike’s career.<\/p>\n<p>It was a far meatier part than any he had previously taken on, and young Mike was a wreck. He couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep. He studied Stanislavski, Meisner, Day-Lewis. He lived, breathed, drank, and smoked biking. Still, his performance was not up to snuff, and the studio was dangerously close to giving him the boot. <\/p>",

On top of all the work he had as the CEO of goodr sunglasses, his extended family was also visiting from Florida and had brought their entire flock of chicks with them. He loved them, but family is a lot of work. A quiet evening reading a book by the fire would go a long way towards recharging himself for the rest of their visit.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Carl really had no intention of reading his book. His real plan was to begin napping as soon as possible and it did not take long for him to start nodding off. Like a chain reaction, the book rested on his lap, which caused his eyes to close, which telegraphed to his brain that nap time had begun. Carl started to feel his body float, his mind drifting, a perfect calm…<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“GRANDPA! GRANDPA! GRANDPA!” his grandflaminglets screamed, as they burst into his study. They came in like an invading army, one knocking over a side table and one just running face first into his chair. They weren’t the sharpest tools in the shed. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“Jesus Christ on a cracker, you monsters!” he yelled, “What the hell made you think it was a good idea to come barging in here uninvited? Didn’t your parents teach you any manners?” Carl tried to fix them with what he hoped was a sufficiently disappointed and angry gaze to get them to run right back out. To Carl’s disappointment, the grandflaminglets didn’t even seem to have heard him. Or maybe they didn’t understand him? Again, not a very smart bunch.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!” they yelled one over the other, “Tell us a story! Yeah! We want a story!” Their voices intermingled and mixed to form a pitch that was in constant flux but always annoying.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Carl heaved his second sigh of night. This one much less cathartic than the first. He knew this insatiable horde of youth would not be turned away with anything less than getting the story they wanted or maybe a bullwhip (but he couldn’t remember where he had left his whip).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“Ok. Ok. Shut the hell up and sit down! Grandpa can’t think of a story to tell you bastards when you’re high-pitched squeals are drilling into his brain.” The kids slowly settled in a semi-circle around Carl’s chair, as he stroked his face feathers trying to think of a way to entertain the idiot children. Finally, the story came to him and he clapped his hands to signal the beginning of the story:<\/p>",

              "text": "<p><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, the grass at the Augusta National Golf Club is the most pristine in all the land. We’re not here to talk about grass though… What about those sandwiches?!!<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>As iconic and illustrious as the course’s white and pink azaleas, the famous Augusta Pimento has been a concession stand staple for 66 years. For an honest $1.50, served in a fairway-green plastic baggy, fans often bring these home to freeze for a later date. It’s all in the pimento cheese, which is just a variation of cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, and pimentos. There have been many failed attempts to recreate the famous recipe. Spoiler alert: Not possible, but definitely worth a shot (see below for our recipe recommendation).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>About 7 years ago the Masters’ pimento situation went to shit. In 1998, the club switched vendors from their OG caterer, Nick Rangos of South Carolina, to the local Wife Saver restaurant in Augusta. Rangos is credited with the creation of the famed pimento cheese sandwich and refused to share his recipe in his breakup with Augusta Golf Club. He (some might say ::cough::: Carl :::cough:::) <i>selfishly<\/i> took it to his grave in 2015. Wife Saver’s owner Ted Goffery was now responsible for pleasing the hungry masses at the Masters. He hit a few bunkers, and lost many a ball to water hazards, but, much like any amateur golfer, Ted found the special touch he was missing and finally knocked a hole in one.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>But in 2013 the Augusta Golf Club said, “F U,” to Ted. They were too high-profile to chance using outside vendors anymore, and moved to producing everything in-house. (Some bullshit seeing the winner’s green jacket is produced in Ohio.) Ted offered a recipe trade in exchange for some badges, but his offer was rejected.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>This was a sad time for Masters attendees. ESPN’s Wright Thompson is quoted saying, “It’s different. There's definitely more spice, and some think there's more mayo. The consistency has changed, sometimes leaving soggy bread gummed up around a big blob of the spread.\" Gross.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Ted to the rescue! Ted knew he had something with this one of a kind product and took his pimento cheese to the open market! Now you too can buy Ted’s Famous Augusta Pimento Cheese on the online outfit called Goldbelly. Yup, you really can buy everything on the internet. May we suggest you start with sunglasses?<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>We’d hate for you to miss out on this marvel, so for all of you viewers at home, level up with this kickass pimento sandwich variation! Let it be known, these green and yellow masters inspired goodr golf sunglasses are great for chef-ing out. You don’t have that authentic green plastic baggy, however these green golf sunglasses are too made of plastic. The main difference: they’re not great at holding or transporting a sandwich.<\/p>",

Flip and pop the whole pan and sandwich in the oven for 7 minutes. Add more butter and put back on the stove top so the side that has not yet experienced the buttery goodness gets all nice and yummy too.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>The way the crust feels will tell you if you’ve reached perfection. Seriously, it’s all about getting that perfectly crispy browning on the outside. When slicing your sandwich, use a serrated knife. Let the knife do the work by sawing through the sandwich, being careful not to compress the sandwich. Yet another chance to cut your finger… DON’T, because that would be painful, and then you won’t be able to enjoy your sandwich as much. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>The opportunity to be invited to play at Augusta makes emotion swell up within. If you’ve made this sandwich correctly, this is how you should feel as you bring your creation to your mouth. If you take a bite and feel actual internal swelling, not just emotional swelling, you’re probably allergic to pimentos and should call 911. <strong>Warning: This sandwich will cause drooling.<\/strong><\/p>",

(In case you’re not familiar with Dynasty, it was a slanderous soap opera falsely portraying oil tycoons as greedy, immoral liars. In 1991, the series was cancelled and everyone involved with it was sentenced to a lifetime of hard labor in the coal mines, to great celebration.)<\/p>",

We recommend dressing up like these popular characters from 1984 hit movies: Short Round from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Det. Billy Rosewood from Beverly Hills Cop, Pyornkrachzark the Rockbiter from The Neverending Story -- the possibilities are endless!<\/p>\n<p><\/p>",

Keep only those items that speak to your libido and your brain after too many Long Island Iced Teas.”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>In the series, The Cheetah, previously known as Dr. Barbara Minerva, visits the pristine homes of Americans and preaches her MinBarba method: Separate all items into two categories, neon and non-neon. Then burn the non-neon items in a bonfire while blasting electronic dance music.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“When we intoxicate our houses, it has an intoxicating effect on our bodies,” said The Cheetah, a diabolical supervillain who famously fought Wonder Woman in 1984. “Reality is a nightmare we must escape. The future isn’t just female. [UNINTELLIGIBLE CHEETAH SOUNDS] The future is neon!”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>As if to illustrate her point, the unhinged human-cheetah hybrid ends every episode of her reality show by giving away pairs of <a href=\"\/products\/the-future-is-neon\" title=\"The Future is Neon\"><strong>The Future Is Neon<\/strong><\/a> goodr sunglasses<strong>. <\/strong>While The Cheetah’s “glowing rave” makeover tips aren’t for everyone, the polarized shades consistently get glowing rave reviews.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>When asked for comment, Amazonian demigoddess and beloved superhero “Wonder Woman” Diana Prince said, “My former friend Barbara is on a toxic path. I cannot condone it. But I LOVE those sunnies! I’ll have to get a pair for Steve [Trevor]. Wait, is Steve alive or dead? I keep forgetting.”<\/p>",

He stood on the deck for hours with binoculars to make sure they didn’t “hit any icebergs.” He had never heard Beyoncé’s music before, and referred to her as “the lady from Austin Powers 3.” And he accidentally broke a glass a day (at least), cracking the same joke after each piercing smash: Mazel tov!<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Irritated, Carl pulled Teddy aside in his cabin, planning to tell the turkey off. But before Carl could say a word, Teddy said, “Yay! We’re alone! Now I can teach you The Way of the Wattle.” Off Carl’s blank stare, he explained that the fleshy protuberance under his chin is the wattle, which changes color based on mood -- red when seeking a mate, blue when scared, etc. Carl found this very uninteresting and guzzled another coconut margarita (which is just a substitute for a piña colada when you’ve run out of supplies.)<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“It’s not just turkeys,” said Teddy. “<i>Everybody<\/i> has wattles. You just can’t see them until you learn The Way!” With a portentous wink, he reached into his neon fanny pack and pulled out a French style rolling pin. “Look, it’s easy,” said Teddy, and smacked Carl in the head.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“Ow!” cried Carl, buckling to his knees. “What the f***?” He got up to insult Teddy, and froze. In the mirror across the room, he saw his reflection. Indeed, there was a wattle. A wattle on a flamingo! His fingers passed through it, but it was definitely there.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“Just accept it,” said Teddy. “Accept the wattle. And look upon your soul!”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“No,” said Carl. “I’m not doing that.”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“Okay,” said Teddy. “Then check out everyone else’s wattle! It wears off in an hour.”<\/p>",

And everyone on the yacht -- especially Jay-Z and Ruth Bader Ginsberg -- thought it was hilarious that the turkey kept breaking glasses and quipping, “Mazel tov!”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Carl realized that the celebrities didn’t feel uncomfortable around Teddy. The celebrities felt uncomfortable around <i>him<\/i>, because <i>he<\/i> was acting so uncomfortable around Teddy. “My bad,” Carl told Teddy, upon returning to the cabin. “No prob” said Teddy. “See, I always want to know how everyone feels.

              "text": "<p><\/p>\n<p>(goodr recently called Glinda the Good Witch for a totally in-vogue 73 question interview. We mutually agreed never to contact each other again.)<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>1. Hi Glinda! How are you? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Really? You’re wasting one of your questions on that?<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>2. How did you start your day today?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By reading my fan mail. Although I receive so much I’ll never get through it all.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>3. What fashion trend will never go out of style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Poofy ball gowns with giant crowns and star-wands.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>4. What’s your favorite book?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have time for books, but that’s so cute you do.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>5. What’s your beauty philosophy? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Only bad witches are ugly.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>6. Can you believe it’s been 81 years since Dorothy Gale’s adventure in Oz?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. It seems like just yesterday I directed her to the Wizard, rescued her from the poppy fields, revealed how to travel home, and basically did all the work.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>7. What’s something Dorothy taught you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes when you lend people shoes, you don’t get them back.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>8. What’s something you taught Dorothy? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Look, I love Dorothy,, but I interacted with her for like ten minutes.. Can we move on?<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>9. How old are you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Aww, you’re still stuck on the linear conception of time? Bless your heart.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>10. Is there a double standard for witches and wizards?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course. Everybody talks about “resting witch face,” but you never hear about “resting wizard face,” do you? <\/p>\n<p><br><strong>11. If you could spend a day with anyone in the world, living or dead, who would it be?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ol’ Dirty Bastard.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>12. If I had 24 hours to spend anywhere in Oz, where should I go and what should I do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google is your friend.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>13. How would you describe your personal style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Helen of Troy meets Princess Peach.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>14. How do you unwind?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have a monthly membership to Consensual Sensual Munchkin Massages, Inc.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>15. Isn’t “Munchkin” an offensive term these days?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. What, an offensive term for short people? Don’t be absurd. Learn your history.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>16. Are you saying Munchkins weren’t always short?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Certainly not. They used to be around six feet tall like humans. But as a ruler, I needed to be intimidating, so I spiked their food with a potion that decreased their height by an inch every year. It happened so gradually they didn’t notice. Like boiling frogs in water.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>17. Do you often boil frogs in water?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes I boil writers from sunglasses companies.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>18. Where does your name originate? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Good question! Originally, it was Galinda, but I dropped the “a” in tribute to Dr. Dillamond, a goat who taught at my alma mater, Shiz University. “We-the!”<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>19. Sorry, what?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>“We-the!”<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>20. What - what is happening?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It’s the chant from Shiz University. You know: “We-the!” “Shiz-nit!” “We-the!” “Shiz-nit!” Pro-tip, honey: Next time you interview a witch, do the bare minimum of research.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>21. What’s one thing that you would like to master?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having the courage not to be perfect.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>22. Are you a texter or caller?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Neither. My phone is a one-way street. People contact <i>me<\/i>. <\/p>\n<p><br><strong>23. What do you miss about Oz when you’re in America?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Everything. No offense, but America… it’s not for me.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>24. You famously said “all good witches are beautiful and all bad witches are ugly.” What do you say to people who think that’s incredibly superficial?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sounds like something an ugly person would think.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>25. Who was your role model growing up?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The beautiful lady who lived in my mirror.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>26. That… You mean your role model was yourself?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You’re a quick one, aren’t you?<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>27. What’s the last movie you saw that made you laugh?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Bicycle Thief.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>28. What’s the last movie you saw that made you cry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Wolf Of Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>29. What question do you wish people would stop asking you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>“What happens after you die?”<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>30. What’s the most extravagant thing in your closet?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My Rolls Royce Sweptail. It’s a big closet.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>31. What’s the most overused phrase right now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>“We represent the Lollipop Guild.”<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>32. What’s the Scarecrow up to these days?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Scaring crows, as he should be. Did you know that when Dorothy dragged him off for that adventure, the crows absolutely devastated my crops? Nailed that straw-man down so it doesn’t happen again.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>33. Finish this sentence for me. Oz of the future looks like…<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The same.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>34. What’s one question you wish you’d be asked more?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>“What was it like creating the Forbidden Fountain?” You know, the Forbidden Fountain with the Waters of Oblivion, that saved Oz from the invading Nome King? A lot of people don’t know I created it.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>35. Okay, what was it like creating the Forbidden Fountain?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Great!<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>36. That’s… That’s it? You don’t like, add---<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Honey, next time you snag an interview with a big celebrity, please take at least a minute or two to write down your questions in advance. Maybe in the future, if you get really good at interviewing, you can try wing it. But right now, well, it’s not working.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>37. What’s one product you can’t live without?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/glindas-resting-witch-face\" title=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/glindas-resting-witch-face\">Glinda’s Resting Witch Face sunglasses<\/a>!! And I know what you’re thinking: I just like them because my name’s in the title and I’m only plugging them because I get 30% of the sales revenue.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>38. ...is…is there a second part to that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nope.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>39. Who’s an Ozian everyone should know about? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>General Jinjur. I know, deep cut. Years ago, she led an all-female “Army of Revolt” to try to take over my throne. Know what she does now? Dairy farmer in Munchkin Country. How quaint. Let this be a warning: If you come at the queen, you best not miss.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>40. What’s a beauty product you don’t go to bed without wearing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sadly, I don’t get the chance to wear beauty products, because all beauty products decrease my natural beauty.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>41. What’s The Tin Man up to these days?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Rusting in the rain. As he should be. You do realize he uses that axe to chop all down my trees, right? No thanks. Deforestation makes Oz look uglier than Elphaba.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>42. Why did water kill the Wicked Witch Of The West?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do you not have allergies in America? If I recall correctly, in your land, 150 people a year die from peanuts. Call their families and ask how it happened. I’m sure they’ll be eager to explain it to you.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>43. Does water kill <\/strong><strong><i>you<\/i><\/strong><strong>?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ha! You wish.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>44. What’s been taking up your days as of late?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Munchkin Hunger Games.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>45. Any big trips coming up?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, going on a cruise with my girl Coo-ee-oh. Krumbic Witch, former queen of the Skeezers, got turned into a diamond-studded swan after that conflict with the Flatheads. Didn’t get along then, but now she’s like my bestie. What up, Coo-ee-oh, you crazy bitch?!<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>46. What’s the best concert you’ve seen this year?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hmmm… Probably 2pac at Ozapalooza.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>47. You mean 2pac as in 2pac Shakur, who died in 1996?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Duh. But he didn’t die. A tornado took him to Oz.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>48. He...what? Really? Is he ever coming back to America?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I doubt it. You didn’t appreciate him until he was gone. <\/p>\n<p><br><strong>49. Are there any other famous people in Oz whom we think are dead?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. Just 2pac.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>50. Does he still, like, make music, and if so, can---<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hey! Is this interview about me, or it about 2pac?<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>51. It’s about you. Sorry. What’s the most overworn item in your wardrobe?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My poofy pink ball gown, followed by my poofy rose ball gown, followed by my poofy flamingo ball gown.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>52. What’s the most underworn item in your wardrobe?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My poofy rouge ball gown. It looks so weird compared to the rose, pink and flamingo.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>53. What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>“Fake it till you make it.”<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>54. What’s some advice you’ve completely ignored?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>“In order to get, you have to give.”<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>55. What’s the Cowardly Lion up to these days?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hanging out at my castle. In the trophy room! [LAUGHS] Got into big game hunting a few decades ago. Lions and tigers and bears, oh my...trophy room! [LAUGHS]<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>56. Are you drunk?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I can quit anytime I want.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>57. Who are the three women that are blowing your mind right now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kim Kardashian, Princess Langwidere and Carole Baskin.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>58. What’s your favorite guilty pleasure snack?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lion jerky. Hey, ask the previous question again! I want to answer it again.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>59. Uh, okay. Who are the three women that are blowing your mind right now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Me, me, and me. [LAUGHS] Bad. I’m so bad. <\/p>\n<p><br><strong>60. Technically, you’re a good witch -- what is it that makes you good?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If I do it, it’s good.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>61. You recently co-starred in your first reality show The Surreal World, with Harry, Jareth, Jordalf, Melisandre and Merlin. What was that like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A beautiful nightmare.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>62. Let’s do some word association. What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Harry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Overrated.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>63. Jareth?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Confusing.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>64. Jordalf?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Innocent.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>65. Melisandre?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Firecrotch.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>66. Merlin?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Squirrel-f***er.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>67. What relationship advice can you share?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>People don’t change. But you can make them change, through magic.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>68. What advice would you give to a 16-year-old Glinda?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You haven’t even begun to peak.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>69. What message would you like to send to your young female fans?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you can’t solve a problem with words, use fire. I actually learned that from Melisandre on the show. <\/p>\n<p><br><strong>70. Do you think you can get away with being vain, cruel and morally bankrupt just because of your innocent persona?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do you think your Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Harley, is still in your apartment? Because spoiler alert: He’s not.<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>71. That’s...wait. How… What happened to Harley?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I magicked him away. Now he’s in my castle. Say hello, Harley. [BARK, BARK]<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>72. Can I have my dog back, please?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. You can’t. Hopefully this will teach you a lesson. Many lessons!<\/p>\n<p><br><strong>73. Seriously, can I have my dog back?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. Say goodbye forever, Harley.

              "title": "“LABYRINTH” REBOOT GREENLIT STARRING JUSTIN BIEBER AND BHAD BHABIE",
              "text": "<p><\/p>\n<p>Sony Pictures has greenlit a reboot of Labyrinth, the 1986 musical-comedy directed by Muppets mastermind Jim Henson. The original movie starred a 15-year-old Jennifer Connelly as Sarah, who embarks on a quest to rescue her baby brother Toby from The Goblin King Jareth, played by David Bowie. Bowie recorded five new songs for the film.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>The “soft reboot” will star 17-year-old Danielle Bregoli, best known as rapper Bhad Bhabie and “The Cash Me Ousside Girl” from Dr. Phil. Bregoli will play Sadie, Toby’s daughter, who embarks on a quest to rescue her baby brother Toby, Jr., from The Goblin King Jareth Jr., played by Justin Bieber. Bieber will record 18 new songs for the film.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“I’m very, very excited to make a freaking movie,” said Bieber. “‘I’m going to watch the original one for sure, when I get time. Not super familiar with David Bowie ‘cause I didn’t watch The X-Files. But I love that dude. He can, like, totally have a cameo.”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Roland Emmerich, the disaster auteur behind Independence Day: Resurgence, 10,000 B.C. and The Day After Tomorrow, will direct the film. Unlike the original Labyrinth, the reboot will be shot entirely in a greenscreen studio, using state-of-the-art CGI instead of handcrafted puppets from The Jim Henson Creature Shop.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“Jim Henson was good for his time,” said Emmerich. “But so were VCR’s, pagers and vinyl records. This dusty franchise desperately needs an update. With CGI, you can do all sorts of things you can’t do with puppets. My film is bigger and better in every way.”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Sony granted the “dark and gritty” reboot a budget of $200 million, nearly ten times the original’s budget of $25 million. Carlos Mencia, creator of the 2005-2008 Comedy Central sketch comedy series Mind of Mencia, will write the screenplay, taking over for the late Terry Jones from Monty Python. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>According to Sony executive producer Raglan Chimeloft, none of the original Labyrinth actors will return, and Bhad Bhabie will collaborate with Justin Bieber on 9 of the 18 new songs. “We’re extremely excited to see what Biebs and Bhabie create,” said Chimeloft. “They’re like the 2020 version of Bowie and Blondie.”<\/p>\n<p>The reboot, entitled <i>Labyrinth: The Day of Reckoning<\/i>, is planned to be the first in a trilogy, and will hit theaters in the seventh circle of Hell late next year. When asked for comment, Bregoli put on her <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/power-of-voodoo-who-do-you-do\" title=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/power-of-voodoo-who-do-you-do\">“Power of Voodoo.

              "title": "“BOY WHO LIVED” DRINKS ALONE AT BAR, HOPING TO GET RECOGNIZED",
              "text": "<p><\/p>\n<p>Ten years after defeating The Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort at The Battle of Hogwarts, 27-year-old Ministry of Magic Auror Harry Potter was spotted drinking alone at the popular Three Broomsticks pub in Hogsmeade Village.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>According to patrons, Potter sat on a barstool “grinning like a goblin,” and making uncomfortable eye contact with everyone who entered. Reportedly “The Boy Who Lived” stayed for hours, offering “free selfies” and striking up unsolicited conversations with strangers.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“Harry Apparated at our table and said ‘You’re welcome,’” said Krystopher Singlegriff, a fifth-year Hogwarts student. “And we were like ‘what?’ And he was like ‘for saving the world. Wouldn’t be here without me, innit?’ And we were like ‘okay?’ Then he offered to tell ‘’some real epic Quidditch stories’ and we were like ‘No thanks.’ He told them anyway.”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“I know Harry, like, ended the Second Wizarding War or whatever, but I just wanted to chill with my friends,” said Melody Mendelgall, a seventh year Hogwarts student. “He was like, ‘Hey, ladies. Man who lived. Probably don’t recognize me, due to the glow-up. Pretty big glow-up, bigger than Neville’s, a lot of people are saying.’’’ It was so cringey.”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Recent photos reveal that Potter transformed his trademark look. The Gryffindor alum now sports frosted tips, <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/accio-shades\" title=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/accio-shades\">Accio, Shades! sunglasses<\/a> and a scar-free forehead, thanks to cosmetic magic. However, an attractive physical appearance doesn’t cloak a repellent personality.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“I was sitting with my girlfriend, Bathilda,” recalled sixth-year witch Rosalee McIntyre. “Harry popped up, ripped out some hair, and slammed it on our table. Then he said, ‘Brew some Polyjuice Potion before you get nasty tonight. Harry on Harry, eh? Harry on Harry? Hero on hero?’ We were like O-M-G. What a creep.”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Potter’s belligerent behavior is curious, since he’s married to fellow Hogwarts alum and Holyhead Harpies star Ginevra Weasley. Three Broomsticks bartender Tom Bockwald speculates that Potter is suffering a quarter-life crisis due to peaking in life so early.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>“At the end of the night, Harry was ugly-crying,” said Bockwald. “He worried his life no longer had purpose and he rushed into a loveless marriage out of convenience. I didn’t know what the hell to say. When he started ranting about how Voldemort ‘had some good ideas,’ I had to kick him out. But he gave me these dope sunnies, so it’s all gravy, baby.”<\/p>",

              "text": "<p><\/p>\n<p>If you want to look younger, meet your new celebrity goals! In the series premiere of The Surreal World, Jordalf the Wizard looks barely 20 years old. Quite an impressive feat for a sorcerer who just turned 2,019! (And quite a contrast from her twin brother, Gandalf, who looks like somebody slapped a Santa Claus beard on an orc.)<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>As we all know, the Valar sent six Maiar spirits to Middle-earth to protect the Free Peoples from Sauron in the beginning of the Third Age. This included Saruman the White, Alatar and Pallando the Blue, Radagast the Brown, Gandalf the Grey and Jordalf the Dope. The wizards started on equal footing, but as we enter the Fourth Age, some have kept better care of their physical forms than others. Jordalf is stunning, Gandalf is showing his age, and Radagast somehow looks even more like he woke up in a dumpster than ever before. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>In an interview with Lothlópolitan, Jordalf revealed the secret to dodging the ravages of time: “I wake up early in the morning and work out with two personal trainers,” Jordalf told the publication. “I also get eight hours of sleep every night, eat a lot of green vegetables and avoid the axis of evil: alcohol, coffee and the sun.”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Hopefully Jordalf shares these tips with her brother, Gandalf, a decrepit husk of a man who stumbles out of bed at noon to “wake and bake” with Southfarthing pipe-weed. Wandering around the boondocks burns calories, but not if you follow it by feasting on breakfast, “second breakfast,” lunch, “second lunch,” dinner and “second dinner.”<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>As if to underscore her awesomeness, Jordalf shot fire-lightning out of her hands at the end of The Surreal World season premiere. The dazzling dancing neon spider web of voltage was far more impressive than any of Gandalf’s pathetic magic tricks, if you can really call fireworks, shield conjuring and resurrection magic tricks. (Yawn.)<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Mark our words: Gandalf is out, and Jordalf is in. The <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/run-you-fools\" title=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/run-you-fools\">\"Run, You Fools!\" sunglasses<\/a> she rocks in the season premiere will be all the rage in Middle-earth.<\/p>",

              "text": "<p><strong>Despite being hungover on shrimp and piña coladas, Carl the Flamingo, goodr CEO, brushed his beak, and put his favorite pineapple print shirt on in preparation for his weekly company wide meeting, Tuesday’s With Carl. This time was different, the flock wasn’t in the office, they were represented by little fuzzy digital squares on a screen in Google Hangouts. All ~60 of them. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Thousands of Americans transitioned from going into the office daily to working from home. “YAHOO!” said the masses as pajama sales skyrocketed. (Probably not true, but having to dress only half our bodies for meetings has been pretty great.) The transition presented different hardships for every business. It has required the drive to persevere, ability to provide clarity, and a universal trust. goodr was set up solid to roll right into what we’ve dubbed the New World Order, the turbulent economic times brought on by the Coronavirus. For that we have much gratitude. What do we have to thank? Our company culture. And through it all, we discovered, a thriving company culture is possible while working remotely. Virtual dance parties and all. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>What is the importance of company culture? Establishing a culture in your business is crucial. It sets the tone for the early employees from day one, and trickles down to everything: your marketing, how you communicate with consumers, and how employees communicate with new hires. When customers and employees fall in love with the culture of a business it is a key factor in helping drive business success. A study from Bain and Company surveyed 365 companies in North America, Europe, and Asia. They found that 81% of leaders believe that a company lacking a high-performance culture is doomed to mediocrity. The really crushing number, fewer than 10 percent are successful in building that culture.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, goodr’s culture has been nurtured from the day co-founders Stephen Lease, Ben Abell, and Keri Blunt brought goodr to life in March 2015. The trio made sure everything they did was infused with goodr’s core values. FUN & AUTHENTICITY. So, when Covid-19 hit and the world went into the Upside Down, goodr did not have to fight to maintain their culture with their team transitioning to working remotely 100% of the time. It was already meticulously woven into the brand plan. With that, the business was able to accept the situation at hand, stabilize, determined where to focus their collective energies, and went back to executing the shit out of everything. Trust us, it wasn’t easy, and challenges presented themselves in ugly ways in the early phases, but alas, we persevered.

Unfortunately. <p><\/p><p>\nLookin’ behind the shades, once the pandemic hit, goodr as a whole was able to adapt pretty quickly. Go take a whiskey shot with Satan, because really, the devil is in the details-- let us explain while we try to hit the cross section of inspiration action. Saying, “We made it through,” isn’t good enough-- and we aren’t really “through” it yet either. Here are the details so you can absorb our wins and losses and translate it back to your business. Last week we talked about these four steps for navigating turbulence: <\/p><p>\n<b>1. Acceptance <\/b><\/p><p><b>\n2. Stabilize <\/b><\/p><p><b>\n3. Focus <\/b><\/p><p><b>\n4. Execute <\/b><\/p><p>\n \nBreezing past acceptance, how in the world did goodr stabilize?\n \nStabilization is crucial. goodr CEO Stephen Lease describes a touch and go on the way to Vegas. You know, like in a plane… you’re going to land, you hit the runway, and then before you know it you’re going back up. WTF.\n \nCoincidentally, Stephen was with co-founder Keri Blunt, on their way to visit Keri’s dad, a United Airlines Pilot.<\/p>",

              "text": "Yeah, that’s gd right. Please fly the plane. That being said, our first goal was to stabilize. This meant standing in front of a room and owning how scared we were.\n \nHOW TO STABILIZE: \n \nCultivate calm: This is achieved by leading by example, and giving people permission to feel feelings.\n \nTransparency: We gave a State of the Union, explaining where we were at as a business. A very simple explanation of, “We thought we’d be here, but we’re here.” We treated people like adults, and provided a high level transparency.\n \nMaking the plan: Next comes making hard decisions, creating the strategy, and going from there. This is where you establish what’s going to get cut and how to move forward.\n \nThe hardest thing in all of this was laying people off. The reality is, we didn’t expect to be in this situation ever. It fucking sucked. When your business drops to zero for a couple of weeks, you can’t just sit in your own pile of shit twiddling your thumbs like a toddler. It’s time to act. We looked at what is going on from a cross flow perspective; a significant part of our business is B2B. Across the country 80-90% of retail shops are closed. Directly relating our decisions to cash flow, and knowing that those parts of the business were going to be taking it on the chin, we were proactive in our next steps.\n <p><\/p><p>\n“We were a company of 68, we laid 8 people off. It was a rough day,” explains Stephen. There is nothing more difficult than losing people you loved to work with, people that are friends, people that helped us get to where we are. “I would like to blame covid, but in hindsight it is 100% my fault.”\n <\/p><p>\nAs the awkward turtle walks out of the room… “To stabilize,” means the making of the plan. Stephen, the Finance Flamingo Lauren, and the Controller, sat in a room and met with each department. We made crazy budget cuts. Picture the hack job your mom did to your bangs for your kindergarten school picture, yup, that drastic.\n <\/p><p>\nTwo or three weeks earlier, the third co-founder, Ben vomited on the ground all of his fears. (Thankfully, there was no actual vomit, and if there was, he lives in Colorado, so we didn’t have to deal with it.) Thoughts of recession had crossed Ben’s mind. The conversation went something like this:\n <\/p><p>\nStephen: What would be awesome is if you could look at our revenue classifications, and look at our expense classifications, and at what point do we need to cut X to make it work. <\/p><p>\nBen: Oh yeah, I’ve been working on that. <\/p><p>\n(2 weeks later… say in that voice they use on Spongebob...)<\/p><p>\nStephen: ...Yo Ben, gunna need that tomorrow.<\/p><p>\n \nExpenses get a little bit more suggestive. For goodr it breaks down to:<\/p><p>\n<b>Critical expenses:<\/b> rent payroll, product<\/p><p>\n<b>Important:<\/b> media, content, raises <\/p><p>\n<b>Helpful:<\/b> Events, lunches for the team, contractors <\/p><p>\n<b>Nice to haves:<\/b> Continuing education, business travel <\/p><p>\n \nEvents, gone. FUN WALLPAPER, GONE. Contractors, gone. Raises, paused. We cut a lot out. No quarantine 15 for our budgets. They were on a strict diet. The plan is to go bare bones until August 1st and then add things back in accordingly.\n <\/p><p>\nThe first part of stabilizing was shrinking everything down and coming up with a game plan. A week later we revisited it, and revised, resulting in our current New World Order. Complete with 5 or 6 backup plans. Fast forward, today, we have 7 plans, and we know what levers to pull at what point. \n <\/p><p>\nAfter stabilizing comes FOCUS. When you lay people off, other people start to worry that they’re going to get laid off. People just wanted to know if they were putting their energy in the right place. So we needed to direct focus. We looked at our strongest source of revenue, good ol' goodr.com, and put our energy there.<\/p>",

We rolled it out to the company in stages. First, as a part of stabilizing, we gave a talk on cultivating calm. Then came the State of the Union, telling people a plan is being brewed. Lastly, we shared the plan. This is the first leg of the race. The goal is that we make it to the fall exceeding our expectations so no one else gets laid off. There was no sugar coating, and we wanted people to feel closer moving through this. We shared our decision matrix and our revised NWO targets.\n  <\/p><p>\nIn March we were looking at 35% down in revenue. The only reason it wasn’t worse was because we were halfway through the month-- 65% down in April, 55% down in May. The summer is our hot season, so experiencing revenue loss in the sunny months burns a little worse. Puns intended. The revised revenue chart has a line for the NWO target and the OG target. If these lines connect in August, we’ve made it to halftime with the lead.\n  <\/p><p>\nThis communication was delivered through decks.

Get it?) look at our culture with the world so we can help and inspire others. We planned on launching mid April, and then BOOM. Before we knew it we were flipped into The Upside Down (thank you Stranger Things for coining that one). Coronavirus became a serious thing. The first couple of weeks were spent stabilizing the business and making a plan. Once acceptance sunk in, things became much sunnier. \n  <\/p><p><\/p><p>\n“I could feel what normal was like, and I could feel it slipping through my fingers, and during that time I was just housing cookies.” Expressed Chief Relationship Officer, Shaun Tinney. How real is that quote? Amirite?!\n  <\/p><p><\/p><p>\nOur team of 60 employees, many of whom were used to coming into the office only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, thanks to our already in place rad remote work policy, were now working 100% from home. During this time we talked a lot about leading with calm, and controlling only what you can control. As Stephen Lease, Chief Executive Octopus (because we create our own titles here and octopuses RULE), shared his uncertainty with the team, acceptance followed. goodr was able to evaluate the situation, create a visual, and say, “This is where Covid is taking us, and if these lines meet in August, we’re good.” Stephen further explains, “The ability to show dates and details are really important. You don’t have to lie and merrymake. We did not try to sugar coat anything.”\n<\/p>",

You’re 5 minutes off the lead.” Or, “you’re half a mile from the finish…” Even if it is only a smidge off, this is NOT helpful. You can’t sit there and lie. So we created a Prime Directive (where my Trekkies at?!). Our Prime Directive was to make sure we stay on track. We have an extremely flat reporting structure broken into 12 Flocks (you can thank Carl the Flamingo, our other more pink CEO for that). We knew what areas of our business were doing okay, and we knew to direct our energy there. This gave everyone the collective goal to move forward, and what a sigh of relief that was. This is probably something we’ll end up keeping around. It was the ultimate clarity needed to charge ahead with gusto. Everyone knew what they needed to do, and we knew where their focus was directed.",

If you create this matrix, look at revenue and expenses, and tag everything, you will know exactly what you need to drop. So if this happens again, you won’t have to determine during a time of panic what to cut. It will be predetermined. All travel, continuing education, contractors, fun culture stuff, is just gone for the foreseeable future. Everything we are doing is on a thinner budget. Raises are on pause.

We strive for transparency. “I don’t know what the right thing is to do, I don’t know what we should do, but I know what we can do.” Another fine Stephen Lease quote from this episode. Acknowledging this breeds trust. “If I want people to do the same to me and tell me when they don’t know something I need to lead by example.” Stephen recognizes that when you talk to people like adults, you realize how smart people are when you treat them smart. Trust is built over time, and this is how we build trust in our culture over time. It is a long game.",

So it seemed like a fun name to describe the section of the podcast where we “circle back” and discuss one thing we were too drunk to remember to discuss.\n <\/p><p>\nThe one thing we didn’t talk about today, is we are really hardcore about making decks, and since we use Google Slides, we can share them. We can always be looking at the same thing together, it’s on the top of the list of why we were uniquely qualified to work remotely.\n <\/p><p>\nThe importance we put on decks is a part of our culture. We have a strict (and beautifully branded #humblebrag) template, and offer classes on how to build decks up to brand standards. Now we’re looking at you Google. Where’s that sponsorship at?\n <\/p><p>\nSome mantras to take away from this episode are: <\/p><p>\n* Treat people like adults and they’ll act like adults. (Message repeat that.) <\/p><p>\n* Done is better than perfect.\n <\/p><p>\nIf you want to let employees work remote when this is over, do it. Let people fail. Learn from it and keep it going. Because in the long run, it’s going to pay off way more than micromanaging ever could. To give support and resources to your employees it brings engagement and the feeling of camaraderie and teamwork. We’re not takers, we’re a team of givers. <\/p>",

Instead, we made sure every connection with our customers was fun and authentic-- our two core values.\n <p><\/p><p>\nGranted, the employees at goodr were already working remotely 60% of the time pre-covid, but that missing 40% of IRL face time was felt. No more watercooler talk, or in our case, seltzer machine talk. Morale and fun are really important in a business environment, we needed to make sure that they didn’t vanish when we transitioned to working 100% remote.\n <\/p><p>\nExternally our efforts to build deeper connections have helped us short term and long term, on the D2C and B2B side.

As we settled in, and the “new normal” started to feel more “normal,” this channel trickled off. It really helped diffuse the collective anxiety from the start. We used drawnames.com to execute a mug exchange. People got random mugs that matched their spirit animal, enneagram test, or favorite dog breed. It provided an easy way for everyone to flex their creativity muscles, while bringing joy and connection.\n <p><\/p><p>\nOn Thursdays we cheers… and sometimes wear pink… Every Thursday at 5:00 p.m. we pop onto Google Hangouts, do a cheers, and dance. You can drink, you can not drink, you can dance, or do a subtle head bop. It’s a chill way to say, “Hey!” to people you might not get to work with in your day to day. \n <\/p><p>\nVirtual team pizza parties were a blast. We were surprised at how many people made their own pizzas. Did pizza stones sell out like dumbbells?\n <\/p><p>\nStephen also started Happy Hour with the CEO. Originally it was going to be lunch with the CEO, but you know… the world got shut down. You get to talk about life, it’s about as low key as can be. Stephen started with the people who have been at goodr the longest and has been chipping his way through the expanding list of flamingos.\n <\/p><p>\nOverall, everyone has leaned in and showed up, and we are so grateful for our Flock Leaders for spearheading all of these different avenues for internal connection.

We review and celebrate the previous quarter and plan for the future. Everyone completes a two minute speed dating slide, going over their success and favorite moments of the quarter. The virtual version included: Pajama Day, numerous virtual workouts, dance parties and lessons, craft time, a goodr game night, movie screening via the Netflix Party app, a cooking challenge, a Draw Carl Challenge via Strava, photo recreation challenges, team trivia challenge, virtual wine tasting night… and we’re probably leaving something off that list... Stephen was particularly jazzed about the virtual wine tasting night. “You can get as drunk as you want, and you don’t have to go anywhere,” he marveled. (Although he is kicking himself now for missing it). \n <p><\/p><p>\nDoes your CEO rap? Virtual track night was another very different, very goodr, connection opportunity. You pick a beat, pick a topic, write a rap, and record it live. By the end of the session you have a rap song. In your head you think you sound like a Grammy Award winning musical artist… We were going to share the track with you but the world isn’t ready for it yet.\n <\/p><p>\nThe Virtual Talent Show was our closing act. Each person brought something. A prime number rap, dog tricks, wine chugging, live music-- it was awesome. Name that tune, and trivia questions are always a big hit with our crew. We talk about “done is better than perfect” every day, an estimated 6.66 times a day to be exact. This was the perfect example of that.

To no surprise, keeping it light and fun made the work that much more riveting.\n <p><\/p><p>\nAnother digital initiative was Carl’s Distraction Attractions, a web page of ways to keep busy while twiddling your thumbs. We also hosted March Mania. Every pair of sunglasses have an icon, so we did a bracket challenge sunglass icon v. sunglass icon, and people vote. It was a way to recreate the cancelled NCAA Championship, although maybe not quite as popular, YET... Theresa, the Digimon that created this activation, dropped hilarious cat butt filled video recaps weekly into Slack. Thank you T.\n <\/p><p>\nOur digital team put forth an amazing effort in all of their initiatives too. No spooky Friday the 13th things, the message stayed light across the board. goodr sells $25 bundles of sunshine. The team amplified this with Happy Hour free shipping; when your audience is most active from 4-10 p.m., it makes sense to sweeten the deal at that time. We hosted a SWEATgoodr challenge, where you could earn up to 20% off for various workouts that you needed to record and send proof to Carl the Flamingo for a custom coupon code. We partnered with Goodwipes, and paired the offer with our Scumbag Scarf-- the perfect quarantine essentials. The day after May 3rd, as to not violate any copyright laws for the 4th of May, we sent our much anticipated Star Wars themed email. Upon the release of our latest pink Circle G round frame sunglasses named, Influencers Pay Double, we gave consumers the opportunity to actually pay double. Nobody did, sadly, because there was actually a cool reward if you did. Lame. We got Carl the Flamingo bot launched-- a new extra witty customer service bot on our website, and we launched a bunch of products. \n <\/p><p>\nOur retail boutique is not open right now, so we used the open space to host an IG Live Happy Hour, anchored around promoting a limited edition glass known as, Can I Tiki Your Fancy? The glass sold out in 24 hours, well before we had a chance to hit “live” on the iPhone. Going live was a blast. If you saw it, it was not perfect. It was authentic and fun.\n<\/p>",

We built our own performance and review system based on <i>Drive<\/i> by Daniel Pink with the goal of no bosses.\n <p><\/p><p>\nCorporate America is full of middle managers. We don’t need that. In the book, Pink (can you imagine if we were talking about the pop icon, exclamation mark for an “i”, P!NK? It’s not...), unpacks how money is a poor motivator. It’s all research based. From here we created our AMP (Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose) project. Autonomy is “I have control over myself.” It’s all about proving to yourself and everyone else how you’re crushing your role. It’s about making decisions and standing by those decisions. It does not mean “no accountability.” It actually means more accountability. You’re in charge of what and how you’re accountable.<\/p>",

You have to have that courage and want to do something different. If you’re in a place where you get undermined and culture change is impossible, you have autonomy, and you have a choice. You have a choice to go somewhere else where that can’t happen. Peace out with pride. \n <\/p><p>\n<b>1.

Deny.)<\/p>\n<p>** Warning: We may reference some common hipster stereotypes, if you think you’re going to be offended, stop reading, grab your guitar, and go strum yourself to sleep in your bathtub with the lights off.<\/p>\n<p>You might be here because you found yourself asking: What are the coolest sunglasses? And what are the most popular sunglasses right now? Luckily, the answer to both questions is: goodr's new round hipster glasses, that's what.<\/p>\n<p>Wikipedia defines “hipster” as a “subculture that emphasizes style, authenticity and uniqueness.” Guess what! Style and authenticity are core values here at goodr (as well as FUN, if that isn’t clear by now it should be by the end of this blog post). SO TAKE THAT. WE’RE HIP TOO. Wikipedia goes on to explain that members of this subculture don’t typically self-identify as “hipsters” and being “hipster” can be seen as being pretentious or overly trendy. WELL. You know what we say to that?! A big ol’ middle finger. Because you can never be too trendy. So grab your skinny jeans, checkered shirt, slap on your mustache and beard, and let’s talk about why you need these particularly amazing hipster sunglasses.<\/p>",

It is served up in six fresh color options and differentiates itself from our other styles with its sleek circular frames and round lenses, so whether you're looking for mens hipster glasses or womens hipster glasses, we've got you covered! This new frame style comes with mirrored reflective lenses and has a non-reflective lens option as well. To be honest, we couldn’t decide which lens style is hipper. Carl the Flamingo, goodr’s CEO, is a big fan of the mirrored round lenses. We suspect that’s because he drinks a lot and the mirrored lens hides the drunk look in his eyes. However, our non-reflective tortoiseshell round frame sunglasses quickly became our number one seller... so it really comes down to personal preference.<\/p>\n<p>To help convince you that goodr sunglasses are the best way to level up your hipster style, or wannabe hipster style, let’s talk about all of the non-mainstream things hipsters like to do that involve wearing sunglasses. Oh! And FYI, before we get too deep in this-- goodr sunglasses can also be turned into prescription glasses or sunglasses. Just take them to your ophthamopple...optimma...tomma… eye doctor.<\/p>",

Cool, noted.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ever attend one of these shows at an outdoor venue and have to squint at the stage? Coachella anyone!? WondToo drunk to remember the squinting… fair enough. It’s time for you to get some funky festival sunglasses, because you know what that squinting does??! Besides wrinkles, it causes lots of wasted eye-fatigue. You probably bought six more <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/nine-dollar-pour-over-origin-story\">Nine Dollar Pour Overs<\/a> (the coffee, not the sunglasses, but it seemed like a good place to link-up these rad hipster sunglasses, because the name just fit too perfectly) than you needed because you tired your eyes out by staring down that favorite indie rocker of yours without protecting your peepers. goodr circle sunglasses offer optimal protection from the sun. Our lenses offer 100% ultraviolet light protection, protecting against UVA and UVB rays. In addition to that, they’re polarized, which means even less squinting! Polarization on eyewear cuts down the glare on objects by blocking the horizontal light waves. What’s better, is that ALL of our round frame sunglasses feature polarized lenses! Yup, you don’t even have to pay extra for polarization. Save those pennies for your third hole-in-the-wall coffee shop stop later today.<\/p>",

So, when you’re on plant patrol, you know, making sure no pesky little insects sneak their way into your thriving strawberry plant and demolish it, put on a pair of goodr round shades.

How about we break it down nice and smooth into the four Fs while hitting the remaining top four answers received on the super unofficial IG poll. It will be like one of those rap performances where you give the rapper words and they have to freestyle it (except with a lot more words in between… sorry, not sorry).<\/p>",

Heck, the human CEO of goodr took the entire company on a booze cruise for a quarterly meeting. If that’s not fun, what is?! We love tiki bars, basset hounds, cool wallpaper, 3:45 is shot o’ clock, and we encourage authenticity all day, every day. goodr sunglasses exist to give you permission to be unabashedly yourself… unless you’re an asshole. We have a color and style for everyone x10, so instead of putting on the sunglasses you think the world wants you to wear, goodr inspires individuality. And not only is that fun, but being 100% yourself will make you <strong>feel like a badass<\/strong>.<\/p>",

Nobody cares about how many miles you did before work, but go ahead, tell us anyways, we know you’re going to. Should you run with sunglasses? Yes! Whether you’re attempting your first couch to 5K or going for the FKT around the world, runners sunglasses are an <em>essential<\/em> add-on to your running accoutrement. While you’re out there destroying your legs, your eyeballs need protection from the sun’s harmful UV rays. Prolonged exposure to the sun is like that iconic, “this is your brain on drugs” egg in the frying pan commercial. Okay, maybe a little less extreme, but the damage certainly adds up over time, thus making it worth dealing with head on. Welcome to the wild world of adulting-- first they tell you to wear sunscreen, now sunglasses… what’s next? Thinking about sunglasses as sunscreen for your eyes is a pretty spot on analogy though. We definitely do not suggest ever applying sunscreen to your eyes. That’s just foolish.<\/p>\n              \t\t<p>* FYI, the acronym FKT stands for “Fastest Known Time.” It is a speed record on any given route, like the Grand Canyon Rim-to-Rim-to-Rim Crossing, or John Muir Trail. And now that you know that, you can enter the next level of runner-nerd-dom.<\/p>\n              \t\t<p>There are a truck load of benefits from wearing sunglasses when running… Particularly goodr sunglasses. The first being the most obvious-- these shades are so flocking cool that you’ll look and feel like a boss, no matter how bad of a sufferfest you’re in, or how ugly your face is. There is magic in these glasses.<\/p>\n              \t\t<p>The other, more scientific, but equally important perks to wearing sunglasses while pounding the pavement (or whatever it is you pound… gross, get your head out of the gutter) include the following:<\/p>\n              \t\t<p>➔   <strong>Prevention of eye damage:<\/strong> Now you can soak in that sweet, sweet, Vitamin D and bronze your biceps while blocking out the sun’s rays from your eyes.<\/p>\n              \t\t<p>➔   <strong>No more debris flying up in there, up in there:<\/strong> Sorry, DMX is on our running playlist (yes, we know he says, “here” and not “there”). Wearing sunglasses while running will block the bugs, dirt, sand, and rocks flinging at you from passing cars. Think about how many times your windshield has cracked, that would suck if the same rock hit ya square in the pupil.<\/p>\n              \t\t<p>➔   <strong>Say, “Goodbye!” to crow’s feet:<\/strong> Alright, well, we’re not selling DIY Botox Kits, but we might as well be. Help prevent “crow’s feet,” aka the wrinkles you get from squinting, also brought on by UV (ultraviolet) exposure by wearing sunglasses while running. We can’t help with those resting bitch face wrinkles though, you’re on your own for that.<\/p>\n              \t\t<p>Bottomline, having the <a href=\"www.goodr.com\">best sunglasses for running<\/a> is a game changer. Fortunately for you, goodr makes a pair for everyone and they’re only $25 or $35 depending on the frame style. Keep reading to learn more about running sunglasses than you ever thought imaginable.<\/p>\t\n              \t\t<p>Check out this nifty table of contents we built so you can happily skip the shit you don’t care about and jump to whatever it is you’re trying to Google.

Duh. Next question.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>Alright, we’ll give you more than a smartass answer. Sunglasses designed for running do all of the things mentioned above, but how? We’ll go on to explain polarization and UV protection in a bit, but first let’s talk about what makes these sunglasses specific to R-U-N-N-I-N-G. goodr sunglasses are all no slip, and no bounce. BOOM. It’s that simple.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>When you’re running you don’t want your glasses flopping around all over your face. It blows. Have you ever tried running with earbuds in? Or even walking with earbuds in? The cord gets tangled-- alright we get it, cords are for old people-- the bluetooth cuts out, a bad song won’t skip, the buds fall out of your ears like a pirate’s hostage jumping ship. It is annoying AF. These are the types of frustrations that make the already unpleasant act of running even more unpleasant. So! Get. It. Together! You don’t want your sunglasses to be the same nuisance as your headphones, and with the right sunglasses for runners, you’ll never have to worry about that again. goodr sunglasses have been rated the highest stay-puttedness factor you can find on the market. Yes, that might not be an actual measurement factor, but trust us when we tell you that these puppies know how to stay. You never have to worry about them sliding down the sweat on your nose, and that’s what makes them stand out as specific-for-running sunnies. Although, to be frank, who wants to deal with slippery sliding sunglasses EVER? Not at the beach, not on the overpriced vineyard tour, not on a bike, not on a hike. Shit, this just got Seussical.<\/p>\n          \t\t<\/div>",

A reflection off of snow, or water, or glass, or the roof of the car driving past you while you’re hoofin’ it down a busy road. That my friends, is what we call glare. You’ve felt it. Unless, you’re a freak that exclusively runs on treadmills, or on a windowless indoor track. Depressing, but you do you. (You also might want to consider getting checked to see if you’re a vampire, just to be safe.) Glare has the power to distort colors, make details blurry, and exhausts your peepers. Many individuals that have been victims of glare will say that, “prolonged exposure (of glare) even gives them headaches and that polarized sunglasses are game changers.” Hey, they said it. Not us.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>So what are polarized sunglasses and how are they different from non-polarized sunglasses? The polarization is a filter that comes from a thin layer in the lenses, a layer that non-polarized sunglasses do not possess. When vertical light hits a horizontal surface, it creates an especially harsh glare that ranges from feeling like a fly buzzing around your head-- you know, the kind that seems like he’s trying to be your friend-- to being dangerously blinding. Quite a drastic scale. So, the polarized filter comes in and dropkicks the light that bounces off horizontally right in its metaphorical chest. (And if you’re anything like the person writing this content, you’ll also enjoy this entertaining one minute distraction, a <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/AiNrPS9Z4fY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">compilation of 32 spectacular dropkicks<\/a>.) In other words, the lenses allow vertical light through, while blocking the intense reflective glare from horizontal light. Meaning, light that bounces off of objects horizontally does not stand a chance, and therefore these lenses significantly reduce glare.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>For this reason, polarized lenses are extremely important when it comes to running in sunglasses. Gosh, especially driving. With the amount of glass and metal surfaces you’re surrounded by, the chance of getting your eyes blasted by glare is high. Not only will glare be blocked, but the lenses also boost the contrast in your vision, making details more defined. If you’re someone who likes to fish, this is why polarized sunglasses are said to be the key to spotting fish below the water’s surface.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>One complaint all polarized sunglasses companies get is the fact that polarized lenses make it difficult to see LCDs, no, not LSD. LCD, or liquid crystal displays. These are found in many digital screens, including phones and vehicle dashboards. It’s a big, “no, no,” for pilots while flying planes to wear polarized sunglasses… and we’re thankful for that rule. We need our pilots to be able to clearly read the LCDs on their instruments.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>So if you’ve learned anything in this rambling hunk o’ chunk o’ text it is this:<\/p>\n                  \t<p>Why should I get <a href=\"www.goodr.com\">polarized running sunglasses<\/a>?<\/p>\n                  \t<p>➔   To reduce eye fatigue<\/p>\n                  \t<p>➔   To improve eye comfort and visibility<\/p>\n                  \t<p>➔   To boost contrast<\/p>\n                  \t<p>➔   To reduce glare and reflections<\/p>\n          \t\t<\/div>",

Wow, we really suck if we haven’t made that abundantly clear by now. If you’re on the mission to protect your eyes, then getting sunglasses with UV protection is the place to start. UV stands for ultraviolet and it is referring to the radiation emitted from the sun. UV radiation when exposed to it long enough can not only damage your skin, but the skin of your eyelid, as well as the cornea, lens, and other parts of the eye. Cue the <em>Jaws<\/em> music. Specific types of cataracts, growths on the eye, and macular degeneration are all potential issues resulting from not protecting your eyes from harmful UV rays. We’re not trying to scare you into wearing goodr sunglasses, we simply want to emphasize the sheer functionality of our product. That being said, all of our sunglasses have UV 400 protection.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>goodr sunglasses block both UVA and UVB rays. UVA rays are known to cause wrinkles and cancer. They have the power to penetrate glass! UVB rays on the other hand don’t have this superpower. UVB rays are best known as the assholes that turned you into a crispy red lobster. Both UV rays are blocked through a separate layer embedded into the lenses. The use of an antireflective coating on the back of this layer cuts down the reflection from ultraviolet light, as well as visible light.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>And what if your eyes are super sensitive and polarized sunglasses with UV 400 protection is not enough? Then you might want to pick a style with wider coverage. We got you covered Boo, and don’t worry, we’ll tell you all about frame styles a little later.<\/p>\n          \t\t<\/div>",

Not only options for eyewear, but socks, shirts, hats, underwear, food, e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g. When you’re running for 6+ hours, who knows what the hell is going to happen, this is what utilizing the drop bag locations is all about. Keeping your eyes happy on an ultra running adventure is crucial. Think about it, once your eyes get tired, you’ll want to sleep, and then it’s game over. It’s kind of like that children’s book, “if you give a mouse a cookie”... or a “moose a muffin,” depending on where you’re from... You’ll scarf down that cookie, inhale that muffin, and pass the F out.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>We recommend having your favorite, most baller pair of sunglasses, ideally a category 2 or cat 3 pair for day time running. If you’re in an extremely exposed, absurdly sunny area, goodr’s darkest lens sunglasses, like our light green lensed <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/gardening-with-a-kraken\" target=\"_blank\">Gardening with a Kraken<\/a> will most certainly do the trick. For example, these would be our choice if you’re taking a stab at the insanely phenomenal Badwater Ultramarathon. This is a 135-mile race from 279 feet below sea level in the Badwater Basin, in California's Death Valley, ending at an elevation of 8,360 feet at Whitney Portal, the trailhead to Mount Whitney. For the dawn and dusky parts of the outing or any extra shadowy sections, it’s handy to have a low-light category 1 or 2 pair on hand too. And when you accidentally lose a pair while disoriently scarfing down Skittles at an aid station, you’ll be happy you packed all of these options.<\/p>\n          \t\t<\/div>",

Whenever the name “Bosley” is mentioned, it is only custom to shout, “LONG LIVE THE KING!” at the top of your lungs. Why? Because Bosley was the basset hound child of goodr’s founding members. He reached a ripe old age of 167 and was carted up a mountain in a vintage pram before passing. His cute little basset toes smelled of Fritos. These sunglasses are the most classic tortoiseshell shades you’ve ever seen, and for that reason they are one of goodr’stop-sellers.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>People are so predictable… of course our black on black OG sunglasses, aptly named <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/a-gingers-soul\" target=\"_blank\">A Ginger’s Soul<\/a> are our most purchased pair of sunglasses to date. The dudes in all four <em>MIB<\/em> movies WISHED they had these suckers.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>We can’t conclude this section without showcasing the sunglasses that made goodr a company: <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/flamingos-on-a-booze-cruise\" target=\"_blank\">Flamingos on a Booze Cruise<\/a>. Our best-selling pink sunglasses, designed after the lush pink feathers and shockingly teal eyes of our avian CEO, Carl the Flamingo. Once upon a time, the entire staff at goodr went on a cruise to Mexico and dressed as flamingos on a legitimate booze cruise. True story. It was glorious. The piña coladas came with candy straws and our female co-founder Keri Blunt dominated the Hairy Chest Competition on the Lido Deck. That’s what these sunglasses represent to us.<\/p>\n          \t\t<\/div>",

If your sunglasses set you back hundreds o’ bones, it’s another story. However, $25 and $35 sunnies are priced right for you to have as many pairs as your heart desires. Why? Well, you’ll likely lose a pair, you might break a pair (thankfully our Customer Service Parrots are out of this world, and fingers crossed they’ll hook you up with replacement parts or a shiny new pair of shades if your story checks out, read more about that <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/pages\/warranty-and-care-tips\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>). Other random scenarios where it is desirable to have more than one pair of favorite sunglasses include but are not limited to: You might forget your glasses and be stoked to remember that you have an extra set hidden in your car. Your friend might forget their glasses. Your mom might forget her glasses… just think, you could be a gosh darn HERO.<\/p>\n                  \t<p>Not to mention, wearing different colors and styles is fun. In video games you get to mix up your look. We can create emoji avatars of ourselves and change our appearance. Why not do it IRL? Every goodr employee will tell you the sheer joy they have picking out which pair of goodr sunglasses vibe with their being in the moment they seek sunglasses. Pretty heady, right?<\/p>\n          \t\t<\/div>",

              "text": "May 2017 was the most influential period on goodr’s short historical timeline. We’d sellout, buy as much inventory as we could, and sellout again. We created FOMO, but it was no way to run a business. A birdy, slash smart friend, planted the idea that if we got better terms with our manufacturer, we could buy more. We took these wise chirps of wisdom and made the call to negotiate better terms. Game changer. Our bank at the time gave us a $100K line of credit, and in that moment it felt like we won the Super Bowl. SDL walked out of his consulting job in the middle of the day, (some say popping bottles of André champagne from each hand) and goodr went from side hustle to start-up. \n<p><\/p><p>\nIn 2016 goodr graduated from an LA apartment to a storage unit. Then came the 800 square foot Cabana >> we started renting warehouse space >> then moved into The Hangr, a 6,000 square foot spot, >> and THEN brought our distribution fully in-house in 2019 with the 35,000 square foot space, known as The Lagoon. Every 14 months we grew out of our location, and now everyone works at home, so wtf.\n<\/p><p>\nAlong the way we won some key awards, which further validated what we were trying to do. “There is not one thing that we did perfectly. We did 50 things well, or 50 things goodr,” expresses Stephen. We made our first press kits by hand and sent them to the running media gurus of the world. In 2016 Runner’s World Magazine made us Gear of the Year. Our sales didn’t balloon overnight, but it gave us massive credibility and allowed us to enter the conversation. \n<\/p><p>\ngoodr has always been the “budget pair” of sunglasses, with quotes that say things like, “These are actually ‘decent’ shades.” We don’t care if we’re called decent. It was a write-up that went along the lines of, “They look like they’re for partying, but they’re also made for running,” when we realized that people actually GOT us! When we are displayed on a page surrounded by $200+ sunglasses it feels like a game on Sesame Street; one of these things is not like the other. Our second style, the BFGs, went on to also be named Gear of the Year in Runner’s World Magazine, and Men’s Health. Shortly after, the company was named one of the Best Places to Work in Inc. Magazine. All of this was incredibly rewarding. What a rush.\n<\/p><p>\nBEAST goodr launched in Fall 2018. This was when we solidified that we are an eyewear brand, versus a strictly run brand. If we were a run brand we’d start making hats and water bottles… Nope. We know eyewear, and we grounded ourselves in this knowledge. Our BEAST vertical covers the OCR, CrossFit crowd. Then goodr branched into BIKE and GOLF. \n<\/p><p>\nThroughout the journey of expanding we had to reset our expectations. You have to grind and build community in order to build it the right way. Shit didn’t blow up like we had hoped. It’s like you’re a brand new company every time you launch into a new space. We had three booming models and then the fourth model that came out, the Super Flys, crashed and BURNED. “We just thought we were putting on our pants and making gold records.” Sorry SDL, not the case. Get ready to experience haters and trolls, as well as other brands throwing shade. We realized we needed to keep innovating and out goodr, goodr. \n<\/p><p>\nEarly on we forgot to check a single-use coupon box… lost $60K on that one…\n<\/p><p>\nQC was a learning curve too. Sunscreen was causing the coating to peel on one batch of product. That cost us big. Our reviews tanked, we had to pull all of that product, and at the time we had no backstock of product.\n \n“You have to be really good at adapting because you’re never going to be able to plan for every scenario.” And if Covid didn’t reinforce that mentality, we don’t know what will.\n<\/p><p>\nStephen does not like revisionist history and wouldn’t tell past SDL a thing. But if he has to play that game he’d tell his past-self to buckle up and trust his gut. SDL is quite a pro at taking the lessons and moving on. “The big things that we’ve fucked up on have put us down paths in a really wonderful direction.” That’s some Enneagram Type 7 way of thinking.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>As for advice for someone who’s got a groovy idea:<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n“Learn to love the work, and find the fun in it.” You better love the journey, you better love the grind. It’s not going to be all roses and daisies. Also, start your company as a side hustle. That way you won’t have to compromise paying rent (which is stressful AF). And most certainly don’t be afraid to pivot.\n<\/p>",

              "text": "We are Brené Brown fan girls, boys, and flamingos over here at goodr. From the moment Stephen Lease quote on quote “open-eyed stared” at her during her Inc. Magazine talk, the obsession began. (Don’t worry Brené, we just really like the way you think). This sparked an idea-- why don’t we start a “Dare to Lead” book club?!! The club has gone through iteration after iteration and is now a 7-week program that all employees eventually will participate in.\n<p><\/p><p>\nAlthough we pull out the wooden rulers and force everyone to go through the book club, it does not mean that they have to agree with everything in the book. And actually, there are no wooden rulers anymore now that everything is virtual. Okay, there never were. The group opens with a preamble that explains that vulnerability is a huge part of this book, and we agree that everything shared in the meeting is confidential, creating a safe space to engage in conversation. As a result, the conversations that are sparked have become the most valuable component of the club.\n<\/p><p>\nFor this episode of the CULTURE goodr podcast, we’re going to pick through the book and pull out some of our favorite key components.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Container building<\/b><\/p><p>\nBy setting out ground rules, owning discomfort, and giving ourselves “permission slips” to feel uncomfortable, you can create the space needed to have tough conversations. goodr uses “rules we play by” to help build the container. Whenever we’re engaging in hard conversations, we lay out these rules, and it lets the air out of the room. It’s easier to get into a productive space when intentions are laid out.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Man in the Arena<\/b><\/p><p>\nWe highly advise you listen to this part of the podcast, because Stephen’s reading of Teddy Roosevelt’s quote is something else. Basically, get out of the cheap seats, the opinions from the cheap seats don’t matter. You need to be in the arena getting dirty, trying big. “The goal isn’t to win everyday, the goal is to try everyday.” Or as Teddy says it:\n<\/p><p>\n<i>\"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\" ~Theodore Roosevelt<\/i>\n<\/p>",

              "text": "<b>Boundaries<\/b><p><\/p><p>\nOur ability in life to set boundaries is really important. For example, the boundary of a meeting. We’re agreeing that the meeting is from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and if that meeting goes over, that is not okay. It may seem like it when you’re in it because you’re excited about the work, but it’s not cool bro. It’s your time. Boundaries get slippery when used incorrectly: “I’m an introvert, so I don’t want to work with customers at an event.” That boundary is not acceptable. You can’t use the word “boundary” to escape responsibilities.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The marble jar<\/b><\/p><p>\nEveryone has a marble jar. When you meet people, they may give you a few marbles, and every time you have positive interactions with that individual, you encourage marbles to get placed in your jar, or you place them in it yourself as you feel the trust building. When someone breaks your trust, they lose marbles. Are you one of those flakey friends??! If your friend is always 20 minutes late to a run, they’re going to have a super empty marble jar. Everyone imagines their marble jar differently. What does your marble jar look like? Is it a big large clear jar or a small opaque jar? Do you give a lot of marbles out when you first meet someone, or wait for them to earn marbles? Or are you like avian CEO Carl the Flamingo and have completely lost all of your marbles and are drunk on an island in the sun? That’s okay too.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Clear is kind<\/b><\/p><p>\nIf Shaun presents a project and it’s really, really, like… insanely, steaming-hot-garbage, bad, and you say, “Hey! Yeah, it’s good.” That is not kind! You’re avoiding ten seconds of discomfort. Feeding people half truths and bullshit is about making the person and yourself feel better. There is no benefit to this. Let people know when they crush it and when they fall down. Expectations are resentments waiting to happen. Practice being CLEAR and everyone wins.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The armory<\/b><\/p><p>\nThis section is about the way we show up as leaders. Are we showing up armored and leading with fear and hurt, or unarmored and leading with vulnerability and courage?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Paint it done<\/b><\/p><p>\nReady to get creative? Grab your brushes and PAINT IT DONE! Stephen explains, “I move a thousand miles a minute and one of my weaknesses is not clearly defining expectations, and that leads to, ‘Oh this is not what I expected.’ When that happens it is 100% my fault because how the fuck would you know what I expected because I clearly didn’t tell you.” Your quiver of brushes include, context, objective, and timeline. Go Bob Ross on that shit and turn your vision into actionable, understandable words. \n<\/p>",

When venting (which is also gossip btw) comes up, we hold each other accountable. “That sounds important to you, you should definitely speak to that person about that.” This exists under the premise of, “what gets measured gets improved.” We want to reduce gossip, so we created a cue around it.

Set the stage, and make it clear that it’s about feedback and not a conversation. Doing this helps prevent individuals from jumping into the defensive zone, and they come ready to listen instead of fight. Teeing it up the right way is crucial, and will help you give the feedback. If you get an eye roll during your feedback session, don’t hesitate to call it out, “Hey that’s a really poor way of receiving feedback.” That will respectively knock them down a peg. If you’re someone who struggles with receiving feedback, seek it out, so you normalize it. Remember that this is all for the name of improvement. And at the end of the day, you don’t have to take it. \n<p><\/p><p>\n“When you start increasing to black belt level, you are giving clear and consistent positive feedback more than critical, so that when you need to give critical feedback, it’s heard.” ~Stephen Lease<\/p><p>\n \n<b>Stephen’s secret sauce formula for giving feedback:<\/b><\/p><p>\n1. Preparation. <\/p><p>\n2. Get clear on your ask moving forward.<\/p><p>\n3. Don’t put ambiguous meetings on the agenda, call it what it is.<\/p><p>\n \nSo how do you invite someone to a meeting where you’re going to give critical feedback? At goodr we have 1:1s monthly, and feedback meetings planned after events. By setting the table for these conversations you can’t hide from them. In doing this, we work really hard to give consistent feedback throughout the quarter, so when we get to our quarterly reviews everyone knows what’s up already. Stephen can be the good guy and swoop in with reinforcing positive feedback. <\/p><p>\n \nStephen has received tons of feedback that has been useful in his career. From being told to ask more questions and talk less during leadership meetings, to conversations with one of his mentors, Morris Miller. Miller once said to him in a discussion, “Stop, stop, stop, you can figure this out.” The context was basically, “Stop making fucking excuses. You can run the company.” Sometimes you need to get hit with that.<\/p>",

It was his first introduction to the wild world of super productivity, and that weekend, he turned to his partner at the time and built an entire GTD system from scratch. Stephen gravitated towards it right away. A year later he actually got to work with his new found hero, David Allen. And he’ll tell you, that man and his company had their shit together. Talk about dialed in. Non-negotiable organization and fully living the practice.\n<p><\/p><p>\nHanssie started working with GTD when guest speaker Mike Willams came and did a 2-day workshop with goodr employees. She was resistant because she had her own system. Lots of color-coded to-do lists, and the Wunderlist app (RIP). Ultimately though, her practice equated to stress-- very dressed up, colorful, stress.\n<\/p><p>\nStephen has an on-going to-do list in Evernote, and honestly isn’t sure how he would function without it. As a type 7 Enneagram, he is a high mover that wants to do it all. He is able to create at will, shut it down at night, relax when he wants to, focus when he wants to-- he gets to make it all happen, because this shit is legit. \n<\/p><p>\nHanssie and Stephen both have hardcore systems and because of their baller organization, they also party the hardest. Hanssie has always worked for small companies, and is used to wearing multiple hats. With GTD she can manage more roles than the average human being, take on tons of projects, even while homeschooling her daughter! FYI-- Hanssie’s daughter has been taught GTD, but like young Hanssie she’s been a tad bit resistant at first and insists on using her own system.\n<\/p><p>\nThe concept boils down to the fact that your mind is for having ideas not holding them. <\/p>",

People are capable of doing the work for themselves and we’re all about giving out the tools so it is as simple as painting by numbers. One way this has played out internally is by creating a Master Deck Theme. Everyone has access to it, and now everyone has the ability to make beautiful decks within brand standards.

Emojis and LOLs always help. You really shouldn’t read tone. There is a responsibility on the reader and the writer. Do everything you can to be clear on your side of it. Stephen feels awkward asking instead of telling… always use please. We need to transition more from speaking diplomatically and speaking directly.

At first it felt like we were trying to download too much info into everyone’s brain. We don't want exploding brains on our hands.\n<p><\/p><p>\nThere is so much more after week one. Everyone participates in READ goodr. The group of newbies read the book <i>Drive<\/i>, by Daniel Pink, and <i>Getting Things Done for Teens<\/i>, by David Allen. Yup, yup, yup, we’re obsessed. The reading concludes with a book club. It is not meant to trip people up, its purpose is to see how everyone is appropriating the new info. \n<\/p><p>\nStephen heard that it takes six months for a person to be fully onboarded to their role. Some gurus will even say 18 months. True autonomy on the other hand takes a full year. Our point? The onboarding process doesn’t stop at week one. From month three to six the Flock Leader takes the reigns. Every new hire gets a special deck created for them (yes, you should feel special). We don’t want our new hires to feel like they’re out alone in the wilderness of goodr. Being thrown into the fire doesn’t feel good. That’s why it’s called fire. It hurts.<\/p>",

Wouldn’t you rather have time to spend training for something radical versus hustling for your self-worth at a job?? Too extreme of an example? Whatever, roll with it. The goal is to do your work and live your life the way you want to live it. Get your job done, and don’t pretend that you’re working to fill up the time.\n <p><\/p><p>\nThere is no corner office, and no VIP parking spot at goodr. If you love what you do and you’re not just trying to get through the day, the idea of chill is much more obtainable. Stephen’s good friend and coworker shared a story about his journey hustling for self-worth. He worked late all of the time and let his relationships suffer because of it. Guess what? That company does not even exist anymore! What an eye-opener. He is now one of the most chill and fulfilled individuals at goodr. You need to be confident in your role and your ability. “I know when you’re 32, you think this is how it's supposed to be… but you don’t have to ruin your life because of it.” You should show up and do your job, and do it well.

The reviews are often focused on what’s fresh in the manager’s mind and glaze over early accomplishments. After Stephen and co-founder Ben read Daniel Pink’s book <i>Drive<\/i>, they realized that they needed to create a performance and review system. \n<p><\/p><p>\nThere are three principles to AMP:<\/p><p>\n<b>Autonomy:<\/b> Directing your own life.<\/p><p>\n<b>Mastery:<\/b> Getting better at a specialty skill, not something that you’re already pro at, but perhaps something a little more intimidating.<\/p><p>\n<b>Purpose:<\/b> This is all about leaving the world a better place than you found it. <\/p><p>\n \nWith the principles outlined by Pink in mind, Stephen and the team recognized that they could do it better than what’s out there. A key learning from <i>Drive<\/i> being that, money does not motivate people. You think it does, but it does not. Thank you Daniel Pink for doing all of the hard work. He created the clay for goodr to mold.\n<\/p><p>\nEveryone has a self evaluation and a committee eval for each part of AMP. All of this gets factored into the individual’s raise. We define each component and we hold people accountable to accomplishing them. By doing so, we’re getting the best out of everyone. It takes a little practice to get your mind around how the system works… For example, if you say, “I’m a good boyfriend.” What are your deliverables on that? Define how you are good at your job. For example, maybe a deliverable is to go on three romantic dates a month. When you know you’re checking all of the boxes you can coast on the feeling of, “Oh I’m doing my part!”\n<\/p><p>\nWe want people to thrive, grow, show up every day and ball out. Doing one great thing is awesome, but you gotta do it again, and again, and again, and you have to grow. This shifts the definition of doing good work. When the time belongs to you, why would you waste it just to get through the day?? We want people to love what they do. At its core, autonomy is the ability to direct your own life and it is the bulk of AMP. We’d break it down to Autonomy is 80% of your role, Mastery 10%, and Purpose 10%. Meaning roughly four hours a week on Mastery and four hours on Purpose. Let’s break it down further...<\/p>",

Does anyone actually enjoy micromanaging? Ughk, don’t answer that… How do we eliminate the word micromanage all together? Answer: Ownership and knowing your own value. Prove to yourself and the entire company that you’re crushing your role. If you’re regularly showing that you’re doing your work to a high level, how can you even be micromanaged? For example, During Tuesday with Carl all departments share updates. The Distribution Center Squirrels share how many packages they’ve shipped. Customer Service Parrots go over how many tickets they’ve solved. Every team has their respective KPIs that reflect the effort of the individuals on the team. <\/p><p>\n \nFor Stephen’s autonomy he has three areas of focus: Chief Culture Creator, Chief Multiplier, Chief Visionary. For Chief Multiplier his goal is getting the best out of everyone. This means 1:1 meetings with Flock Leaders, compensation planning, and a bunch o’ staff meetings. He has it mapped down to the number of quarterly expected meetings. If he gets them done, he can clearly say, “I earned an ‘A’ here and this is why…”<\/p>",

As a part of this, he had to deliver three 10 minute speeches to goodr peeps, do one speech to 100 people, so on and so forth. As a result, he spoke at Running USA, to over 700 people!!! And had an epic experience speaking at an Inc. Magazine conference. It’s all about carving out the time to hone in on one skill. Shaun got certified in the Enneagram for his Mastery Project. When determining a direction for this project, it helps to ask yourself: What makes you the most uncomfortable? What is something you need to learn? Doing so forces you to put in the time to get it done. When you make people come in quarterly and debrief their efforts on it, shit gets done! It’s a built in accountability system.",

He was not alone in his love for orange. Artists like Monet, Gauguin, Renoir, and Toulouse-Lautrec created extraordinary visual effects with the color orange. While Monet painted it into sunsets, Toulouse-Lautrec used it to symbolize the energetic vibes of Parisian dance halls. Toulouse-Lautrec was an interesting character too. He loved booze so much that he hollowed out his walking stick to fill it with his favorite cocktail, the “Earthquake” (his invention). This was a mix of 1 part absinthe and 1 part cognac.

              "text": "Succeeding isn’t just about ability. It’s also about ambition. You could have all the talent in the world, but if you’re timid, you’re going to struggle to make your dreams come true. Which brings us to Shaun Tinney’s book recommendation: “It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want to Be” by advertising guru Paul Arden. Shaun says, “From absolute personal responsibility to problem solving, making mistakes, and generally playing your cards right, this little book is a fun and interesting read that offers a different take on the path to success.” Praised by critics as short, funny and provocative, this ‘pocket bible’ should help you actualize your dreams. Except for that dream where you’re riding a dragon unicorn in space. That will be difficult to actualize.",

              "text": "We started this podcast to give whoever is listening (this could include your dog) a behind the shades look at goodr. We wanted to share our culture with the world and hopefully inspire others. You only really hear about 1% of the things we do. So if you really want to hear our dirty little secrets… just ask us! \n<p><\/p><p>\nThese listener questions came from IG, and our website.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>How did you come up with the idea of using funny names for your glasses?<\/b>\nStephen gets this question a bunch. Flamingos on a Booze Cruise was the first pair ever designed. Once the idea for goodr came about, this was the pair he had in his mind. Pink frame, teal lenses. “These look like I’m on a booze cruise with a flamingo!” he exclaimed to unamused co-founder Ben. The idea happened in 30 seconds and we never looked back. There is something in this story about trusting your ideas and running with them. goodr is a fun brand, and we were also just getting started. And guess what-- these names are fun and they’re free! No turning left from there.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>How did the birth of Carl the Flamingo CEO arise from this?<\/b>\nIf you see goodr’s original branding it was all primary colors, red, blue, yellow-- for those of you that didn’t pass kindergarten. As the brand rolled out we realized that it wasn’t right for our vibe. We had a tropical thing going on. For each pair of sunglasses we do an in depth origin story. That previously unamused co-founder Ben wrote a wild tale about being on a booze cruise with a bunch of flamingos, and Carl was the king of the flamingos. So fast forward, we’re shipping sunglasses out of our apartment, and setting up our return label in ShipStation for the first time, and for fun, Stephen typed in Carl the Flamingo. So when it came time to finally rebrand, we knew we wanted icons, Carl became the icon for Flamingos on a Booze Cruise. A yeti was created for Iced by Yetis, and so on. Ultimately, an amalgamation of things happened at once and out popped Carl.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Your content is a work of art, what inspires your team?<\/b>\nWhy thank you! Yes it is! We have legit 10 people in-house pumping out our beautiful content. Everyone is empowered to create cool shit. We provide a clear brand outline. By setting these loose guidelines people can color them in the way they want. We release so many products and so much content. We do it over and over and over again, and in this process we lean into “done is better than perfect”. We can try different fun things because tomorrow you get to do it all over again!\n<\/p><p>\n<b>How long does it take to come up with and produce a new line of glasses?<\/b>\n58 weeks. We have an abridged 42 week version, but 58 is ideal. Imagine this… we’re going to drop 120 new pairs next year and every pair has a 58 week plan complete with a very stacked deck of deets. We give everything an appropriate amount of time, and give it the proper amount of attention. We do this because rushing things has potential to water down the brand. We talk about this in our GTD episode… so if you want more on that, listen <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttps:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/s02e05%E2%80%9D\">here<\/a>!<\/p>",

You can surely expect goodr’s famous no slip, no bounce, all polarized standards. Let’s face it, glare can ruin your day. Polarization to the rescue! Wearing sunglasses relieves golfers’ eyes from intense sunlight. Getting the ball airborne and headed in the right direction is almost impossible if you can’t visually judge the distance to the hole. This is important because, ummmmm... correct us if we’re wrong....gauging how far a shot needs to go is pretty much the whole game of golf? Drive that shit with confidence because you can actually see where you’re sending it. <\/p>\n<p>On top of exceptional UV and polarized protection, goodr has dubbed our golf-specific lens technology: Flamingo Eye™. All the HD contrast and performance without any of the self-importance. The lenses used within our golf line are truly made with gophers on the brain. Did we say gophers?

With all of that FUNCTIONAL, FASHIONABLE, FFORDABLE style, you’ll be able to focus on the game because you look fly and feel comfortable and confident. Because that’s right! ALL of our sunglasses are either $25 or $35 dollars!

The OGs, which are inspired by a super classic frame style that originated in the 50s, are goodr’s signature style. The BFGs, which properly stands for Big F*cking Goodrs, as they are a larger model with enhanced silicon inserts. A great option if your melon is a little large or if you just like more coverage. Lastly, there are the ever-so-glamorous, The Runways, a sleek cateye shape with some extra grip. These beauties will surely make you look and feel like a model while you golf. Each style comes in its own version of argyle-printed, and flamingo-printed frames, in addition to an array of lovely solid color options. With so many choices at the best possible price, we wish you luck picking your favorite. It’s harder than you think.<\/p>",

Chad ruins the day by having a few too many during the front 9. Insert eyeroll emoji.) Now, we knew what “shanking it” was, but here’s some research we did about the physics of a shank:  a shank happens when the golfer hits the golf ball on the innermost portion of the clubface, so far toward the heel that the golf ball is contacted by the rounded hosel. Most commonly, a shank results in a ball that shoots out to the right (for a right-hander) at a severe angle. Then you yell “Shanked it!” so at least people are aware that you know you suck. Awareness is the first step. It is at this moment that a ball to the eye is far too probable. Smart choice to wear goodrs old chap! Your eyes are safe, thank goodness. Oh no! Your lenses got effed in the process? No worries, even though you only forked over $25 bones for these puppies, goodr has a stellar customer service team that would love to take care of you if you give ‘em a good story (even better if you add a dog pic)!

No. So it probably is not the greatest thing for you.<p><\/p><p>\nOur glowing screens of death that we use for hours a day x 365 days in a year are causing digital eye strain and blue light exposure. Fact. These are the two areas that doctors and researchers are directing their attention. The American Optometric Association calls it “Computer Vision Syndrome.” Ever feel blurry vision, dry eyes, headache or neck pain after a day full of Zoom meetings or an all-nighter trying to beat the latest version of Grand Theft Auto? Yep, this group of eye- and vision-related issues could be from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader, and cell phone use.\n<\/p><p>\nThe increased amount of screen-gazing, America’s new form of stargazing (sadly… please, we’re begging you, don’t stop stargazing!) also exposes us to dreaded blue light waves. Nope, not Bud Light, b-l-u-e light. The scientists can’t get on the same page with how blue light exposure affects your eyes, but it’s been said to cause multiple issues. Primarily, researchers and doctors can agree that it wreaks havoc on your circadian rhythm.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is how GAME goodr likes to think of it: When you’re deep into your game and you have the option to hit “save” do you? Heck yes you do! Because even though you’re a baller gamer, it’s better to be safe than sorry right? You could die a bloody death around the next turn you take, but at least you will be able to go back to the spot you hit save at. Same applies to blue blockers. If your eyes are important to you, then you should be doing your best to keep them safe. Hit save people!<\/p>",

Every 20 minutes stop what you’re doing and stare at something 20 feet away, for 20 seconds. (He advises not to stare at people, this can lead to awkward interactions and misinterpretations…) The purpose? The 20-20-20 rule allows your eye muscles to chill out for a second, helping reduce eye strain. We don’t realize how focused we get on our screens when we’re in the zone.<\/p>",

Over five years, the company has grown to over 60 employees, added four verticals (beast, bike, golf and game), collaborated with major brands (Warner Bros, PBR, The Rolling Stones), and won several awards (Runner’s World Gear Of The Year 2x, PGA Buyer’s Choice, Men’s Health Best Buy, Inc. Magazine’s Best Places To Work). <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dwww.goodr.com%E2%80%9D\">goodr.com<\/a>\n<p><\/p><p>\n* The names are Professional Respawner, Side Scroll Eye Roll, Wakka Wakka Wakka Wakka, Modern Day Snake Oil, Blue Shades of Death, Insert Coin To Continue, Rage Quit And Hit It, and It’s Not Just A Game. <\/p><p>\n** Yup, allegedly. Scientists disagree. But we figure if blue light might be bad for your eyes, you <i>might<\/i> as well take the precaution, while looking like a living thirst trap. (No <i>might<\/i> there!)<\/p>",

              "text": "Coronavirus trashed everything. We’re tired of saying that. You’re tired of hearing it. Or reading it. Whatever. But bear with us because the ending of this story is well worth the repetition and tinnitus. So, March. Remember March? We don’t either, except that our own Stephen Lease was at a Lakers game, loving life, drinking a cocktail, sitting way too close to other fans, and thinking that there was no way that virus thing in the news will be a big deal here in the States. PSYCH!  \n<p><\/p><p>\nBecause fate is a cruel mistress, Season 1 of this podcast was all set to begin recording that same week in early March. DOUBLE PSYCH! \n<\/p><p>\nWell, you can take that double psych and stick it where the sun don’t shine ‘cause at goodr, we are constantly challenging the status quo and if something doesn’t work out the way we planned, perhaps it requires an improvised tapdance to make something truly fun and authentic. And let us tell you, Carl’s tapdance was out of this world. We felt feelings we didn’t know we could feel. Flowers bloomed and baby birds were born, singing the harmonies of his song. \n<\/p><p>\nSo we pivoted. The podcast was still on, but shifted to a mini season discussing the goodr reaction to Covid-19 in real-time. Our culture was already uniquely qualified to continue to grow and thrive while we sheltered in place, but like all retail, we knew hardships were ahead. Stabilize and execute was the overarching plan in the New World Order (NWO). We adjusted our revenue goals, cut the budget, and re-shifted priorities. Check out the <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttps:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/the-culture-goodr-podcast%E2%80%9D\">season one episodes<\/a> to hear more about how goodr stayed on the floating safety raft as everything we knew before sunk into the icy depths. BTW, Rose, there was TOTALLY room on that door for Jack… \n<\/p><p>\nSix months after that fateful Lakers game (we’re not blaming you, LeBron. You are a national treasure. Never change.), and six months after we had to physically separate our flock, we have continued to focus our efforts and wanted to check back in with this new bonus episode to let the world know how the plan has gone so far. Hint: nothing goes to plan. Accept it. Move on. \n<\/p><p>\nIn essence, there are several themes that have emerged since the initial stabilize and focus goal. We feel that these are all completely attainable for everyone, whether individually or as a team. It’s not rocket science. It’s flamingo science. Or Flamingology, if you will. \n<\/p><p>\n<b>Theme One: Focus on Controlling what You Can Control<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSo there’s a helluva lot we can’t control right now. So don’t focus on controlling what you can’t. Because that’s silly. We just said you can’t. What we CAN control is our spend as a brand. Hence, cutting the budget. But we focused on this to a point where we now have this nifty matrix that matches revenue goals with spend. It’s very scientific. The x-axis is the spend quantities: critical, important, helpful, and nice to have\/super fun. The y-axis indicates our revenue growth: good, fair, poor, bad. Get it? This allows us to instead of thinking about cutting when disaster strikes, focus on and celebrate the additions when they are available.<\/p>",

You’ll be getting a buttload of discount emails anyway), what is a creative way to still create that connection with the consumer? Mike claims the goal of this year’s strategy was to <i>add<\/i> value to the shopping experience and purchases as opposed to <i>subtracting<\/i> value from the goodr brand. \n<\/p><p>\nWe’ve made mistakes in the past of coming to the BFCM table too late, rushing the promos, staying siloed in our efforts and communications. That only adds more chaos and speaking to our values, that is not having a very sharp axe. This year, don’t get in the way of the downswing because We. Are. Ready. Every flock has been involved working together to make this year happen. And we’re ready to crush it.<\/p><p>P.S.

He records those in a closet at home.\n<p><\/p><p>\n<b>How do you keep work from interrupting your time off?<\/b> Zero notifications turned on, ever, and when Stephen leaves the office on Friday, he’s done. And we all know and respect that. \n<\/p><p>\n<b>Are you productive during your commute?<\/b> Sometimes. Stephen has an 18 minute commute. After recording the podcast on Wednesday he takes a ten minute break, gets in the car and calls Shaun to prep for the next week’s recording. Talking on the phone while driving is the best-- hands free of course. If he has nobody to chat with, he pops on a podcast.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>If you randomly decide to go golfing tomorrow afternoon, how would that change your day today?<\/b> He wouldn’t do that… but okay… if there is a ridiculously rad opportunity, Stephen would look at his calendar and politely ask how to get out of all of the meetings he had. He’d make it work, and if he couldn’t, he’d feel FOMO for a few hours (or days…) and move on.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>What’s your favorite CULTURE goodr concept that you use in your personal life?<\/b> Feedback. Stephen finds himself giving feedback regularly, and guess what? People do not like it. What’s the alternative though? He sits there pissed and they think what they’re doing is okay. Nope. Not in SDL’s world!\n<\/p><p>\n<b>How do you use stuff at goodr for difficult convos during the holidays?<\/b> First, listen. People want to talk. Then ask, “What value does that represent for you?” People can’t handle that question, and it stops them in their tracks. It’s a great tool to use to ask people what something really means to them.<\/p>",

A snowshoer had broken their leg and was being transported by rescue. My first 50K a gentleman slipped on the dewy grass of the black diamond trail we were running down, he screamed in agony waiting for medics as I tiptoed by him.

There is an award for “Best Ass” so we decided to take full advantage of the R-rated festivities. You couldn’t not cackle running behind that scene.

I felt it happening, as if I was lucid dreaming. A gorgeously ornate wrought iron fence appeared in the trail in front of me. Standing freely. It was stunning. So much detail. I knew as the vision materialized I was hallucinating. I took a picture of it with my mind and it morphed back into a prickly bush in the shadows.

Again?? which was originally released with our Interstellar Sun Repellers line in 2019. \n<p><\/p><p>\nFor those of you who have not yet been enlightened, Mercury retrograde is a phenomenon where it appears Mercury is moving backward from our view on Earth. Scientists say it’s an optical illusion, to which we say, “YAWN. BOOO-RING!” If you want the TRUTH, talk to astrologists!\n<\/p><p>\nAstrologists, such as cosmic crystal healer Celeste Moonbeam,* say Mercury retrograde wreaks havoc on communication, contracts, travel, technology, and our ability to problem-solve and make strong choices. And, hold onto your heartspace, because a Mercury retrograde starts TOMORROW. \n<\/p><p>\nLuckily, Moonbeam infuses these shades with protective energy to keep your chakras powered and your electronics working. THANK YOU STAR MOTHER!!!\n<\/p><p>\nAs for the other two Rewind sunnies...you’ll have to wait. Moonbeam said if we reveal too much too soon it’s bad for your aura. So we’ll just give you a hint for each: Jelly beans and a famous lift (like, dance lift, not a British elevator). <\/p><p>\n\n* This is just the beginning of your spiritual awakening. In a few months, Celeste will be back with a magical top-secret line of crystal healing optics that will land on your astral plane and blow your effin mind.<\/p>",

Nostalgia is like a spice - a little bit goes a long way. Probably a good thing we’re ending the Rewind series now.<\/p><p>\n\nThe THIRD and FINAL sunglass we’re bringing back from the dead is… by the way, did you know that in the sixth Jason movie, lightning brings him back from the dead? Seriously. This dude, Tommy, digs up his grave and stabs his corpse with a fence post to make sure he’s dead, and then lightning strikes it and Jason’s resurrected as a zombie. (Way to go, Tommy.) Apparently, lightning is magic. Ridiculous. But it still makes more sense than the Freddy movies. Did you know that in the fourth Freddy movie, a dog peeing fire on his remains brings him back from the dead? We sh*t you not. A dog peeing fire. Google it. <\/p><p>\n\nAnyway, the third and final colorway iiiiiiiis: <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/nobody-puts-baby-carl-in-a-corner\">Nobody Puts Baby Carl in the Corner<\/a>, which originally launched in our 80’s Beach Party line. These pink and white sunnies with chrome lenses are inspired by self-expression. As you go through life, you’ll discover you have amazing talents, and nothing should stop you from reaching your true potential. Don’t hide in the corner -- show off on center stage! Also, every time we literally put Baby Carl in a corner, he gets scared that the walls are closing in and pukes. And the puke is pink and white. The sunglasses are inspired by that too.<\/p><p>\n\nWell, that wraps up the Rewind series. Wow. What a journey. From the cosmic magic of Mercury retrograde to the delicious joy of jelly bean-infused cocktails to a vomit-spattered metaphor for self-expression. We laughed. We laughed again. We laughed a third time -- we pretty much just laughed. And now the journey is over. But don’t get too bummed out. Someday, this journey will be rebooted.<\/p>",

It’s imperative to quite literally and figuratively roll with it (the snow, the winds), while meandering across the middle ridges of the mountains like Madulce Peak, be it slow, but always with a relentless passion to prudently pursue what pains you most: progress. It’s within these deep discomforts that the greatest self-discoveries are to be had in Her presence.

Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit.” \n<\/p><p>\nWhat Wikipedia fails to mention, perhaps this info only exists on WikiLeaks, if anywhere, is that these famed Masters golfers started their own Green Jacket Mafia. It all began with a bunch of middle aged dudes sitting around eating pimento cheese sandwiches rocking their prized sports coats and matching <a href=\"https:\/\/goodr.com\/products\/green-jacket-mafia\">green golf sunglasses<\/a> with pride. One member decided he was gluten and dairy intolerant, he’s asked to not be named, but we know he is one of the 17 golfers that have won the jacket more than once… We’ll call him Pete. \n<\/p><p>\nNow that Pete couldn’t partake in sandwich eating, he was bored. These slobs sit around joking and gnawing on sandwiches all day, I want to be known for something! So while the men ate, Pete started to tinker. He used his over $2 milly in winnings to invest in robotics. His first project was to engineer golf ball retrieving squirrels. It was a lot of work, but he finally had a prototype that looked like a squirrel, until of course you stare into its dead mechanical eyes. Squirrely 2.0 was capable of getting programmed to retrieve specific small objects within an 800 meter radius of the main operation station. Revolutionary work, truly! It was a completely innocent device, until the mob mentality of green jacket wearers decided to take it to the next level…\n<\/p><p>\nThe Masters started messing with neighborhoods near golf courses. This is what happens when you have too much time on your hands… Plus, who needs to practice when you’ve already mastered the sport? It was very unsuspecting mischief and they didn’t do anything crazy, as to not get caught. Simple, yet infuriating cruelties, like moving car keys, hiding sunglasses and wallets. The individual just felt like they had a stinky brain fart and went about their day. But it was the sneaky robotic squirrels, controlled by the golf pros. Only a few people legitimately lost their minds over these tricks, but nobody could prove it was the work of the Green Jacket Mafia.<\/p>",

My heart was sprinting.<\/p><p>\n“It’s a cougar,” my friend Eli responded. Not because I needed him to tell me that – it was very clear that the large cat in front of us wasn’t a bunny rabbit. It was the size of a quarterback and its long tail dangled from its muscular haunches. <\/p><p>\nEli’s obvious words were simply to fill the space between paralysis and panic. While our fight-or-flight instincts decided how to respond to the threat of a wild carnivore with jaws of dagger-teeth and legs that can leap 40 feet in a single bound.<\/p><p>\nIt couldn’t be more fitting that we were standing face-to-face with a large predatory feline at the end of this particular run. We were on our 35th mile of the day, and nearly every single one of those miles had thrown some new and heinous challenge at us. We’d endured harrowing river crossings, slick hillsides where we slipped and slid into faceplants and beehives, and steep scree fields that turned our ankles into jelly as we surfed loose rocks for thousands and thousands of feet. And, of course, the fatigue from traveling so many miles on foot – all for a run we were doing for “fun.”<\/p>",

This particular loop has a several-mile off-trail section that travels over Yakima land. The tribe allows recreation on this stretch of earth, but hasn’t developed it to include a formal trail. We’d foolishly believed this was because they didn’t want to encourage too much recreation, but we soon realized it might have more to do with how downright hostile this slice of land is.<\/p><p>\nThe end of the designated trail deposited us onto the rim of a glacial canyon that felt closer to “cliff” than I prefer my running terrain. We gazed at the ground ahead of us and glanced down at the GPX track of the route – which was our primary guide through the off-trail section. The track on our screens instructed us to go straight down the belly of the beast of a scree field. We stared ahead in disbelief. Then back at our map – which confirmed we should plunge our bodies into the steep and rocky abyss. \n“You should go first,” I said to Eli. Mostly to spare myself the embarrassment of a witness to my movement. I have all of the grace of a drunken giraffe on loose and dicey terrain.<\/p><p>\nEli scrambled down the rocky slope. His arms waving in every direction. His feet two-stepping across the sea of boulders.<\/p>",

We’d scoured the internet for trail beta before the trek, but information was real scarce and none of it did this section any justice.<\/p><p>\nWe continued on across the vast valley of the glacial canyon.

If that’s too much work, here goes: The Barkley is the world’s most secretive and infamous ultramarathon. It’s been taking place in the rugged mountains of Frozen Head State Park in Tennessee since 1986. In the 36 years the race has been held, only 15 people have ever finished it. One-five. No other race in the world is harder.\n <p><\/p><p>\n<b>Why is the Barkley so incredibly difficult? You got a few hours?<\/b>\n <\/p><p>\nIn a nutshell:<br>\nThe race is officially listed as exactly 100 miles. It’s actually closer to 135-ish.<br>\nIt’s net elevation change is listed as 0 feet. True. It’s five loops. But each loop is believed to contain at least 12,000 feet of climbing and 12,000 of descent. So, math, that’s more than 60,000 feet totally climbing a drop, basically double that of any other ultra in the world.<br>\nAlso, it’s basically all off-trail.<br>\nAlso, the entire course is choked with brier-infested hillsides that will shred your legs to bloody, fleshy coleslaw and cliffs you could easily fall off to your death.<br>\nAlso, the weather can fluctuate between bright and warm to epic downpours to freezing sleet to chunky-style-soup-thick fog in a matter of literal minutes.<br>\nAlso, there are no course markings. You just have to copy a map and carry a set of very confusing directions.<br>\nAlso, you have to find books hidden throughout the woods, tear out pages, and bring them back to camp to prove you were there. (This year there were thirteen.)<br>\nAlso, the course changes almost every year, becoming increasingly harder. So each year your attempt the Barkley, it’s the most difficult iteration of the race that’s ever existed.<br>\nAlso, you don’t know when the race will actually start. It could be any time from midnight until noon on race day. You have to listen for the sound of a conch shell being blown. Yes. A fucking conch. When you hear it, it means the race will start in an hour.<br>\nAlso, you have 60 hours total to complete all five loops. And let me remind you, only 15 people have ever done that ever.<br>\nAnd all of this is the fever-dream of ultrarunning’s resident mad scientist Lazarus Lake.<\/p><p>\n \nSo, do you still want to run the Barkley? No, no you do not.\n <\/p><p>\nBut yet there I was, setting my tent up in Frozen Head State Park, hurriedly trying to beat the monsoon-level rains that were forecast to pound the course, just a few hours before the start.\n  <\/p><p>\nI check in, get my race info. My bib has the number 59 on it, and a red balloon with “Be Very Afraid” written in big, bloody letters. I shudder, glad that I’ve never actually bothered to see It.<\/p>",

(“Lentil soup? What a lame final meal if I die,” I think.) I try to lay down to grab a little wink of sleep, but the rain sounds like a machine gun on our tarps.

I lean over and ask someone, “Uh, aren’t we supposed to get watches?” “You don’t have yours yet?? Go up to the tent and get one.” I run over to the tent and someone hands me a box. I open the box, and instead of a cheap wristwatch, it’s… a pocket watch. A fucking pocket watch.

This is simultaneously the coolest and creepiest part of the race. I have to admit, it does feel like we’re trying to escape prison. Or hell.\n \nSaying goodbye to the ghosts of all those serial killers, we turn our attention to the last bit of the loop. Time to put my big-boy-Barkley pants on. There are some mean climbs ahead. We’re nailing the nav. But the mud, weather and vert have taken a toll though. Our group of four dwindles down to two. Then, down to just me. At Book 13, the final one of the loop, my new vet best friend Harald tells me to go on without him. (Unfortunately, it’s not quite as dramatic as those “Leave me here to die! Save yourself!” scenes in the movie.) So, I take off sprinting down the trail and back to camp alone.\n <p><\/p><p>\nOf course, since you’re coming into camp, you gotta make it look good. I approach the Yellow Gate and have Laz count my pages. “Fourteen?” Uhhh. “Lemme count again. Twelve.” Uhhh. “OK, one more time. Thirteen.” Friggin’ PHEW. My time for the loop: 12:22. Not great. But then I learn that that the leaders arrived at 10:21, which is the slowest frontrunner lap in Barkley history. Wow, I guess this year is tough. Maybe I’m not too terrible after all?\n <\/p><p>\nI retreat back to my campsite, change gear, and shovel as much food into my gullet as I can. We dry my feet. They legit look like a corpse’s. They’ve been wet for more than twelve hours now. Yikes. After about 30 minutes, I’m back on my feet and ready to head out on my next loop.<\/p>",

Back at the gate before heading out, I joke with Laz, “A virgin doing a counterclockwise night loop solo… what could go wrong?” What indeed.\n <p><\/p><p>\n__\n <\/p><p>\nI leave camp, totally alone. Three and a half hours till sundown. Up and over the first climb, I’m feeling confident. I refound the first book, no problem. I shoot the bearing towards the next book on my compass. It seems… wrong. I do it again. Same thing. I look down at my compass. I’ve written “The compass doesn’t lie” on a piece of duct tape that I’ve put on the compass to remind me to trust it. Alright, compass, I think. Here goes nothing.\n <\/p><p>\nI start flying down the insanely steep hill towards the book. After a short while, I can see the creek below with confluence where the book should be. Perfect! I nailed it. Hell yeah!\n <\/p><p>\nI get down there. No book. No landmark I’m looking for. No nothing. It doesn’t look like the right part of the creek. Or the right creek?\n <\/p><p>\nI quickly decide to sweep down-creek looking for the proper spot. Nothing. I spend 30 minutes running up and down, looking at my map, shooting bearings. I’m dumbstruck. I have no idea where I even am on the map. Gulp.\n <\/p><p>\nJust. Breathe.\n <\/p><p>\nI look upstream and suddenly see an orange blob. It’s my vet friend Harald, standing in the exact same spot I had been standing when I realized I was in the wrong place. He’s also looking at his map, confused. It’s like dejà vú. I shout to him over the raging creek, and we try to figure out what’s happening. We have no clue. Reunited, we thrash up and down the creek again, unable to find anything that looks remotely like anything on our maps. We’d both following the correct bearing but ended up in the wrong spot. But we didn’t even know where that spot was. Thirty minutes later, we look up to see a THIRD guy standing in the exact spot we had been standing, now looking at HIS map confused. All three of us have done the exact same thing. The problem was, we don’t know what we’ve done.\n <\/p><p>\nWe spend the next hour semi-frantically tracking up and down random creeks, staring dumbly at our maps and checking our compasses to make sure they haven’t magically become demagnetized. At one point, I found the skull of some animal. “It’s a sign we should probably get out of here,” I say grimly. But between the three of us, we can’t make heads or tails of anything. It’s starting to get colder and darker. Drizzle begins again.\n <\/p><p>\nThe only thing we can do, we resolve, is to hike all the way back up to the top of the mountain and the previous book again in the hopes that we find some clue as to where we should go. We shoot our bearing. Theoretically, if we’re in the wrong spot but we follow the same bearing that we did on Loop 1, we wouldn’t reach the book. We spend 40ish minutes grunting up the climb and arrive exactly at the book. What the actual fuck. “We’re in the Barkley Bermuda Triangle!” I exclaim.\n <\/p><p>\nAt this point, I figured the only logical explanation is that we were totally at the right spot but a tidal wave washed down the creek before we got there and swept away all the features and the book. It feels fairly plausible right now.\n <\/p><p>\nNothing makes sense anymore. On top of that, we’ve lost sunlight on the climb. And a thick fog is starting to set in. Oh, and it’s getting colder and really starting to rain. We sit next to the book we already found, heads in hands. The book’s title is “It Certainly Wasn’t Easy But I Sure Had Fun.” Right.\n <\/p><p>\nIf we can’t find the book with daylight and the correct bearing, we’re never going to find it at night in the fog and potential hypothermia. None of us want to say it out loud, but our Barkley is over.\n <\/p><p>\nAfter getting all the bitching out of our system for a few minutes, we swallow the remnants of our pride and turn to head downhill and back to camp. It’s a gut punch and a kick in the balls.\n <\/p><p>\n__\n <\/p><p>\nThe Barkley will break you. Physically, emotionally, occasionally mentally. If you ever want to believe you are good at anything, don’t ever do the Barkley. All but fifteen people in the world have had the same fate: abject failure. And this year, the failure will literally be of historic proportions. Only two—yes TWO—people will go on to finish a second loop before the cut-off time. It’s the worst run in Barkley’s long history. Eventually Jared Campbell and Luke Nelson will go on to finish a third loop too, just barely before the 40-hour-cut-off, with only 56 minutes to spare.\n <\/p><p>\nAs for us, we saunter back into camp amid a fresh downpour in the dark of night. Laz jokes, “But wouldn’t you guys rather be out there right now?” Yes, yes I would.\n <\/p><p>\nIn a final act of humiliation (or is it respect? I can’t tell), “Taps” is played on a bugle to signify the end of the race for each runner. I’m tapped out, a bittersweet moment that I always knew was probably inevitable but still couldn’t consider.<\/p>",

Where do we strike that balance between striving towards excellence and stopping to smell the roses along the way? What do those goals mean if we aren't present in the rest of our lives? <\/p><p>\nI feel like it can be easy to distill our lives down to the sacrifices we make towards achieving our dreams. To bed by nine, disciplined training, well-timed nutrition, focused recovery. But the flip side of that is leaving dinner parties before you're ready, skipping a packrafting trip, or hike with people who are important to you, having to say “no” to a spontaneous adventure. <\/p><p>\nI have always been at odds with the part of me that knows what it takes to race at a competitive level and the part of me that wants to dive into life with an open mind and adventurous spirit. And when heading home to Hawaii to spend time with loved ones following the loss of a family friend, I wondered how I would balance wanting to be present while also preparing to run a 3:30 50K, the qualifying time for a World Championship Team, at the end of the week. <\/p><p>\nDay one in Hawaii, I landed in Kona and was picked up by a high school friend at 9pm after a long travel day. While I was excited to see her, I let her know that I still had to rest up for my race. Instead, we ended up staying up till 1am catching up. While I had no regrets, I woke up the next day feeling groggy and less than ideal.<\/p>",

I continue to talk to people long after they have walked away from the conversation. I get lost in my living room and walk with purpose straight into walls on a daily basis. So when my husband, Adam, dragged me kicking and screaming into a CrossFit gym four years ago, it was not that I didn’t think that I could do CrossFit, it was that I absolutely knew I could not do it. How could I, being totally blind, not smash my face on something let alone even begin to learn how to use a barbell, do pull ups or any of the millions of other things that crazy CrossFitters do?<p><\/p><p>\n \nI was born with a genetic eye condition called Retinitis Pigmentosa, which typically causes progressive vision loss beginning with the peripheral vision and leaving a person with what is called tunnel vision. But I was never typical. I lost my central vision first, taking away the ability to see details and depth perception, and over time I was left with small islands of peripheral vision. I thought that going blind would be the hardest challenge of my life to overcome, but when I woke up one morning and could not move any part of my body without excruciating pain everything changed. <\/p><p>\n\t\nI was diagnosed with Lupus carrying the symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis and for the next few years saying that I was crippled and over medicated would be an understatement. I could not step off a curb without my knees buckling, was constantly having ulcers in my mouth cauterized, developed circulation issues, would wake up screaming because I simply moved in my sleep, I could not dress myself and the list goes endlessly on. Eventually, I ended up hospitalized and told that I was in total liver failure and as my doctor and my husband discussed transplants, infection, and death I sat there thinking that this could not be real. I had my son, Cooper’s, baseball game to go to and my baby Easton needed his mom to sing silly songs to him.<\/p>",

Photophobia, is an extreme sensitivity to light, and is not only painful but can also cause damage to my eyes even though I can no longer see. This is why my goodr sunglasses are an essential piece of my wardrobe. I left Miami empowered once again by the support of friends and strangers alike, but this time I left with a determination to be a part of making a difference in adapting the sport for visually impaired and blind athletes. <p><\/p><p>\n \nNow I write this almost exactly one year later, honored to be participating in the most inclusive CrossFit Open ever-- that has not just one adaptive division but eight. I am in the Vision Division and every workout has been adapted perfectly to keep the playing field fair regardless of a person’s degree of sight loss, and most importantly safe for all athletes. This is the start of something huge! I choke up thinking to myself how before CrossFit I was so embarrassed to admit that I was blind and now I can hold my head up high and proudly say that I have a chance of going to the CrossFit Games as a blind athlete. Who would have thought that burpees would have anything to do with giving me such a blessed life.<\/p><p>\n \nI always wondered as a kid what my life would be like once I was totally blind. I certainly did not think that I would be able to say that I am more confident, stronger and happier than I ever was with vision. In the end it really comes down to not just accepting the challenges that life gives us but embracing them and using them to keep pushing forward. Never give up on yourself because what you see as the end may actually be the beginning of something spectacular.<\/p>",

I used to be heavily in the pinup scene and I had to pick a pinup name-- so I went with Bearcat because it is a 1920s term that means female with an attitude problem, but I’m a lady about it DAMN IT! I still go by Lady Bearcat but a lot of people just call me T.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>What is your title and role at goodr?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nGame Shark aka Head of Game Community Management <\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>How long have you been gaming and what does gaming mean to you? (Yes, we can be sentimental too. Style points if we get a little misty-eyed with your answer here...)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nI’ve been gaming since I  was a kid, so over 30 years now, my dad still had his old Atari and my brother and I got to give it a try and instantly enjoyed it. Then when Nintendo created the NES my brother and I got it for Christmas, second generation with the dual Mario and duck hunt game in one cartridge because we couldn't afford the first generation when it came out. From there my brother and I would pool our money together to buy new video games and new gaming systems. <\/p>\n<p>\n\nMind you this was at a time where digital download didn't exist. We would go into Toys “R” Us and have to go to the video game section, take a piece of paper with a picture of the game we wanted and a barcode up to the cashier and after we paid for it take our receipt to the gaming “cage” and pick up our game. Now as an adult I have to buy them by myself and pay the full price, but at least I can just download them straight to the console these days. <\/p>\n<p>\n\nGaming has always been a way for me to escape and just do something fun. I feel like I’m always worried about something in my life and gaming allows me to forget everything and just exist for a few hours. It’s been a great way for me to connect with coworkers, friends in different areas, and even get people together for a couch co-op.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>How do you spend your time outside (no, mobile gaming doesn't count)?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nI actually have a few games I like to play on my mobile but for me I tend to go on walks and find trails to explore. I really enjoy putting on an Audible book and getting lost in a story while I walk a few miles. I am also a big concert goer (though outdoor music festivals are not my favorite, but I have to wait outside the venue before the show, so that totally counts, right?)<\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>We’re told health and fitness are important in the pro gaming space. What is your overall health, exercise, and nutrition routine? If you don’t have a routine, per se, what’s the one thing you do to be in top form for competing?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nI am probably the worst person to ask this question to. For nutrition, I really eat whatever I want. I love candy and you would probably find more candy in my fridge than “real” food. As far as exercise goes I try to go on a three to seven mile walk daily or at least four times a week, though in full transparency I only started doing that so I could feed the squirrels at the park, because one day I hope to convince them to join my squirrel army.<\/p>\n<p>\n\nI also have a Ring Fit and a few other movement type video games that I use for fitness as well. Beat Saber is a great work out.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<b>What are some of your favorite games?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nThis is a tough question because there are so many games I love and I finally joined the Playstation community by purchasing my first Playstation ever (unless you count the PSP). I still have my Dreamcast and love to throw on Crazy Taxi or Sonic. <\/p>\n<p>\n\nI do love Diablo III, it is one of my favorite games. I love being able to mindlessly kill monsters without really any strategy or plan. I have it for my Switch and now play it on my PS5. I also enjoy Mortal Kombat (11 is amazing), Smash Brothers for Switch and Gamecube, Mario Kart, ToeJam and Earl is a classic favorite, Breath of the Wild, Rocket League and I could probably go on. I still have some new ones I just purchased that I haven't had time to play because I started playing Diablo III again (I can't even begin to think of how many times I’ve finished this game and played it from the start again). <\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n\n<b>What is your favorite song right now that gets you pumped every time either to work out or play games, and why?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nAnother tough question, as I mentioned I go to a lot of concerts and love music. I have several song lyrics tattooed on me but it’s hard to put my finger on a song that pumps me up. I usually can pick a song that describes my mood perfectly. Usually when it comes to music I stay in the Punk, Ska, Pop Punk type but will throw on some good 80s from time to time. “We’re Not Going To Take It” by Twisted Sister is always a good motivation song.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nFood hacks are my life. Pick up a box of Entenmann’s chocolate frosted donuts and put them in the freezer before eating them. It is life changing, if you need any more suggestions, I’m here to help.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

My cousin, my sister and I cheered when he finally did it! His win was all of our wins! BUT it was all downhill from there... My older sister and cousin said I could play as long as I stayed alive in the game. The controllers stayed in my hand long enough for me to maybe move 5 feet and then it was GAME OVER for me! Needless to say, joystick controllers and me are not friends. I will either end up looking up at the sky, get stuck in a corner or just make my character dance. I started to get back into gaming when the Wii came out and we played Super Mario Bros and I loved it!

(Yes, we can be sentimental too. Style points if we get a little misty-eyed with your answer here...)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\n\nSince I can remember... as a kid I would play on those handheld LCD\/LED games you get from Wal-Mart that only had one game on them and were real cheap and could break easily. Then upgraded to the OG Game Boy. Of course as I was older it was a means to connect with my three brothers, hovering around a N64 that finally introduced 4-player games... convenient. Then in high school\/college I graduated to PC gaming and never looked back. We would host Diablo 2 LAN parties in my friends barn on the weekend. It's family and community!<\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>How do you spend your time outside (no, mobile gaming doesn't count)?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nSwimming mostly! Short hikes-- we live pretty close to Griffith Observatory so we like doing that hike on the Observatory Trail. <\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<b>We’re told health and fitness are important in the pro gaming space. What is your overall health, exercise, and nutrition routine? If you don’t have a routine, per se, what’s the one thing you do to be in top form for competing?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nI have weak ankles so running isn't really my bag. I prefer the low-impact of swimming and cycling-- I spend at least an hour on the bike trainer every day. I also eat pretty healthy, recently went from veganism to seaganism. Don't really have a sweet tooth so not much sweets\/sugars in my diet. Lots of whole foods and home cooking.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<b>What are some of your favorite games?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nOh brother, is there a limit to the number I can list? My go-tos are anything ARPG (action RPG) so like Diablo 2, Diablo 3, Grim Dawn, Path of Exile. I used to work for Blizzard so have played my fair share of WoW and Hearthstone. In college I played A LOT of EvE. And then classic Nintendo titles: Smash Bros, Mario Kart. My all-time favorites are Final Fantasy Titles. In order of favorite to not as favorite but still love: 9, 12, 8, Tactics-- yes, 7 bores me. Don't @ me. I'm a whiz at Minesweeper.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n\n<b>What is your favorite song right now that gets you pumped every time either to work out or play games, and why?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\n“Unheavenly Creatures” by Coheed and Cambria<br>\n--or--<br>\n“Dear Maria, Count Me In” by All Time Low<\/p>\n<p>\n\nemo is life.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nThe photo is me on one of our content shoots with the Dept. of Dreams!<\/p>\n<\/div>",

(Yes, we can be sentimental too. Style points if we get a little misty-eyed with your answer here...)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nI started gaming when I was a child. The games I played growing up have shaped me and stuck with me today, they had the same impact on me as the books I read and the movies I watched on repeat. I have a nostalgic place in my heart for all the games that made me. You can not analyze my childhood and development without reviewing the games that helped shape me. <\/p>\n<p>\n\nToday I don't explore the newly released video games as much as I go back to the old ones. It's like watching a classic movie. Playing a classic game takes me back to my childhood. <\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>How do you spend your time outside (no, mobile gaming doesn't count)?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nI workout outside every week day rain or shine, wind or heat. I’ll be outside for an hour run or a strength training session. <\/p>\n<p>\n\nOther than working out you can find me in the mountains, either hiking, camping, playing in the snow, swimming, or relaxing lakeside. <\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>We’re told health and fitness are important in the pro gaming space. What is your overall health, exercise, and nutrition routine? If you don’t have a routine, per se, what’s the one thing you do to be in top form for competing?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nI put workouts as a priority in my life. My main focus in exercise is so that I can stay healthy and happy. I have an outdoor bootcamp trainer I work with M-F sometimes twice a day. Then on the weekend I focus on spending time outside hiking, biking or just getting some fresh air. My nutrition is also important to me. I don't eat junk food or really any snacks, sodas or energy drinks while I’m playing video games either. I know there is a cliché around junk food and gaming but that's just not me. If you do that-- great. Do what makes you happy. <\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>What are some of your favorite games?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nMy earliest memories of video games was sneaking into my cousin's room and playing his Nintendo NES, mainly Donkey Kong. Shortly after that we got a Nintendo 64 and games like Aladdin and Mario Party are still embedded in my mind. Next I got the Gameboy color as soon as it came out and games like Zelda and 102 Dalmatians still play through in my head when I dream. PS2 and Xbox consoles quickly followed as contributions to my household. Games like Kingdom Hearts, Jak and Daxter, Need For Speed, Grand Theft Auto are staples to my pre teen years. Then I remember when the Wii came and it changed the way we played video games. Now we were jumping and involving our whole bodies. I could play Just Dance till we had no energy left to stand with my friends at sleepovers. I could workout to a Zumba dance on my Xbox Kinect to help get in shape. Things changed so much over the years it was fantastic to get to be a part of that change. <\/p>\n<p>\n\nToday my go to games are the new Switch versions of the old games going back to the nostalgia factor. I still play all the Mario games, (Mario 64, Mario Party, Mario Kart), Mortal Kombat etc. <\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>What is your favorite song right now that gets you pumped every time either to work out or play games, and why?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nThis is not my favorite song. But a song I relate the most to a video game is “Headstrong” by Trapt. It was part of the MX unleashed game when I was growing up. I must have played that game countless times, and always that song was on. So every time I hear that song I'm ready to go play games, take off on a run, or crush it in a beast workout. <\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nThanks for making anyone who plays games feel like a gamer. I've never associated myself with the gamer group. But I play games, they may not be what you like but they are what I enjoy and make me happy and that means everything.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Their current range for customer satisfaction is 90-95% positive at all times. Meanwhile, the industry standard is 75% positive. (HA. Suck it, industry!!!) During a slow time of year, goodr receives 50-150 new customer emails a day. During peak season (like the summer, when people are outside wearing\/damaging their sunnies), goodr receives up to 760 new customer emails a day. That’s right, 760! You’re getting anxiety just thinking about it, aren’t you?\n <\/p><p>\nThe customer messages range from cranky to heartwarming. For example, last summer, Crafty was told via private message to go f*** herself with a flamingo beak. (Yikes.) She had already done everything in her power to help this customer, so she didn’t respond. For cranky messages that require responses, Crafty recommends an enormous amount of self-depreciation and a 100% guarantee to understand and solve the issue. \n <\/p><p>\nOn the positive end of the spectrum, last year Crafty received fan mail about the SWEATgoodr initiative. A woman wrote in to say she loved this event. As an avid runner in New York City, she felt sad, scared, isolated and confused during the pandemic. However, SWEATgoodr inspired her to submit a Strava workout where she ran around NYC in the shape of a parrot. She thanked goodr for getting her out of her home. It was heartwarming. (Uh-oh.

Carl’s Booty is an initiative that surprises and delights the customers. The Parrots decide who gets it and make sure to spread the love, so they’re not just sending to superfans.\n<p><\/p><p>\nFor example, one woman said her sunglasses arrived covered in ants. (WTF?) goodr doesn’t allow food in the distribution center, so there’s no way the box was shipped with ants. However, the Parrots sent her a new shipment, AND an anteater plushie! The Ant Lady wrote back to say the gift was adorable and made her so happy. (Does she like that we’re calling her the Ant Lady? Too late, we are.) CS gives out 2-3 Booties a month.\n <\/p><p>\nWhat’s one thing the flock leader wishes people knew when they reached out to Customer Service? “We promise you that if you have received a shipping notification that the package has left the facility,” says Crafty. “Even if the tracking is not updating.” After packages leave the facility, there’s not much CS Parrots can do to speed their arrival, since magic is banned. Too bad, b\/c teleportation spells are handy. Sigh.\n <\/p><p>\nCrafty says her biggest f***-up was not staffing enough parrots to meet the business needs of 2020. The biggest shift made was creating a structure to set the CS team up for success while celebrating everyone’s individual strengths. She’s most proud of the Parrots for their communication skills, dedication, and reliability. They always show up for each other, and for the company. Also, they always show up at parties they weren’t invited to. How do they find out about the parties? Nobody knows. Probably magic.\n <\/p><p>\nIn closing, Crafty offers three cheat codes: 1) You can choose to be happy or you can choose to be right. Our team always chooses to be happy. 2) If you’re not writing a reply with a smile, come back to it later. And 3) Get as much info as possible in the first exchange, to decrease the amount of back and forth the customer has to experience. \n <\/p><p>\nListen to the episode to get all the juicy details.

              "text": "<p>Sarah, the Flock Leader of the Rack Pack (lame title: Warehouse Manager), joins Stephen and Shaun to talk about her department. The DC exists in the same space as the goodr office and handles everything coming in out of The Lagoon: full container, organized, QCd, Stored, packing the orders and getting them shipped out. Last year, they shipped over 434,000 packages. (That’s more than the population of Iceland!)<\/p>\n<p>The Rack Pack’s Areas of Focus are Shipping and Receiving, Organization (maintaining a clean and safe workspace), Teamwork, Cohesion (communicating back with the other flocks), and DC Culture (fun and safe workspace for the DC flock.) During COVID, the team had to be in the office every day, but stayed together, connected and safe.<\/p>\n<p>At 8:15am every morning, The Rack Pack has a meeting called the Flamingle. They share the daily numbers, talk about issues or changes, review daily roles, and do fun things like decide who orders lunch, or award gold stars, or share icebreakers. Sarah created the Flamingle to find a way to get the same info to everyone as the team grew. Slack isn’t the fastest way for her team to get information. (Shots fired, Slack!!!)<\/p>\n<p>The Rack Pack’s Flock Values are Teamwork and Responsibility. One person can only pack so many boxes a day, and they want customers to get their orders as expected. Running the DC is challenging because it’s infinite. The work never ends, and it gets repetitive, so they do an amazing job of keeping things fresh and fun all day long. They set up a Mario Kart-style tricycle course for races. There are cornhole tournaments. And all day long, they blast sick music playlists to keep up the energy.<\/p>",

I’m talking about those mornings when you wake up tired, and you start to think about the hundreds of miles you’ve run over the previous weeks, and you don’t know how you’re going to get up to do it again. I’m talking about those days when you start to ask questions, like, why am I waking up before I want to, to run farther than I want to, to be more tired than I want to? And I’m talking about those days when you aren’t terribly satisfied with the answers, and yet you still summon the forces deep within you to convince yourself that, yes, you have to run again today and, in fact, you have to run very far and, of course, you don’t want to but, despite what you might think, you actually need to run about forty-four miles today across the Grand Canyon and back because, really, you need to be able to do that if you’re going to run the Western States Endurance Run, a 100-mile footrace through the mountains and canyons of California, next month.<\/p>\n<p>That’s exactly what went through my mind last week when the alarm went off and I really didn’t want to get out of bed.

I reached out to the Laughing Valley Ranch in Colorado, the amazing owners of Dominick that agreed to rent him to me again.<\/p>\n<p>We set out for the 17.5 mile distance with Dominick’s other donkey buddy, named Winkie. The two spent most of the race playing rabbit, switching the lead and horsing around.<\/p>\n<p>The day was hot but the donkey boys seemed unphased. The course climbed up tough but gorgeous mountains, traversing through varying terrain- including a deserted mining town and a few streams.<\/p>\n<p>Dominick went through the water-crossings like a champ! Donkey’s are mistakenly labeled as “stubborn” but I’ve learned that they have a highly developed sense of self-preservation.<\/p>\n<p>We had some long and thoughtful pauses but also moments of surprise intervals. Think uphill sprints!<\/p>\n<p>In the end, we stayed together and finished as a team! The most embarrassing thing would have been for Dominick to run across the finish line, without me in sight. Imagine the finish line photos.<\/p>\n<p>Another racing rule states that you can push, pull, drag or CARRY your donkey across the finish line but you cannot ride them.

For the digital marketing nerds (we know you’re reading this, blogs are like catnip for you), goodr’s conversion rate last year was 6.7%. Over time, Dan taught himself how to make jetpacks, and soars to work every day like the majestic Rocketeer. Just kidding. Over time, Dan taught himself to ask difficult questions but still have fun. (Like by building jetpacks.) \n <\/p><p>\nIn the lightning round, Dan says if he could travel back in time to any era, he’d visit the Old West. (“I mean, have you seen Back to the Future III?”) On social media, he posts inspirational quotes in the form of dumb dad jokes. He prefers tacos to hamburgers. He likes couches more than recliners. And his spirit animal is the mighty Kraken. (“I like the symbolism of the giant sea monster being able to crush ships at sea, and when you cut its arms, they grow back stronger,” he says.)\n <\/p><p>\nDan’s journey to goodr began when Gandalf the Grey arrived at his house in Hobbiton, and demanded he serve dinner to 13 unruly dwarves. Just kidding. He worked with Shaun for around 8 weeks, and became friends. Shaun told Dan that his friend Stephen just started a company that makes sunglasses for runners. As a runner, Dan loved the sunnies, and bought about 30 pairs Later he connected with Shaun and SDL, who said, “You know what goodr needs? You.” And Dan replied, “A female sheep? What in the heck would you need that for?” (Okay, he didn’t say that last part, but he totally should’ve.)\n \nDan’s lame title is Head of Direct to Consumer business. His fun title is Professor Rex, or P-Rex for short. Other dino-fied titles on the team include Media Megalodon, Propaganda Peddling Plateosaurus, and Tommy Pterodactyl. And what does D.I.N.O. stand for? D = Direct to consumer. I = innovation. N = No lame AF sales. O = Olive Garden Eaters. That’s right, they love The Olive Garden. Unironically. Will The Olive Garden give D.I.N.O. free food for life for plugging them on the podcast?!?! No. No, they won’t. But it’s worth a shot. \n \nDINO distributes all marketing and cleans up the website so it’s optimized for conversions and sales. They’re responsible for the revenue channel of all D2C business. Their flock values are Innovation and Perseverance. Dan says they have to try new things all the time, since digital marketing changes all the time. That means never giving up on a good idea and never not giving up on bad ideas. If DINO has a bad idea and they feel strong about it, they go for it, as the risk is low. “Dan is really fucking good at what he does,” says SDL.\n<\/p>",

If so, what is it and why?<\/b><p><\/p>\n<p>\n\nMy name is Erica but I go by RockoShocko on most gaming platforms. My name is Rocko because many years ago, I called my coworker Turk (from Tarzan). We worked at Ultimate Electronics in Phoenix, AZ. He reminded me of Turk with crazy hair and snippy attitude. He was so hilariously offended, he called me Rocko, like the wallaby from Rocko’s Modern Life. (Fun fact, I love cows, iykyk.) So, Rocko kind of stuck. One night, signing up for my first WoW account, I was naming my Dwarf and Rocko just came to mind. Boom. I became RockoShocko circa 2006. <\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>How long have you been gaming and what does gaming mean to you? (Yes, we can be sentimental too. Style points if we get a little misty-eyed with your answer here...)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nI first started out with Sims. I was a ranch kid with limited access to many things. When I turned 17, I got my first computer and my grandparents saw Sims next to the register. They thought I would enjoy it after school and riding horses all day. I was sucked in. Playing till 3 in the morning almost daily. Then, I became a scene kid and slowly drifted away until I got a job at Ultimate Electronics. There, I met my future roommates and they introduced me to Wow. Again, I was sucked in. Missing work occasionally because I was stuck in a raid. That’s how it all started. <\/p>\n<p>\n\nIt was an outlet for me, especially being on my own in my own apartment. Struggling to buy groceries and pay bills, but my best friends and roommates had the internet and spare computers for me to lose myself in. Nothing was better than stepping out of my real life stressful black hole into Azeroth. <\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>How do you spend your time outside (no, mobile gaming doesn't count)?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nNow that I’m a stay at home mom, I spend a lot of my time outside either camping, fishing, or exploring during trail runs. My four year old just started soccer so I’m officially a soccer mom. Oooph. 6 years ago I never thought that would be my jam. I preferred to lose myself in Pc, PS4 or Xbox realms. But now I get to share that love with the next generation of hybrid gamers. (Athletic gamers!)<\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>We’re told health and fitness are important in the pro gaming space. What is your overall health, exercise, and nutrition routine? If you don’t have a routine, per se, what’s the one thing you do to be in top form for competing?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nI’m actually an aspiring Spartan athlete. I run and lift weights 6 times a week and when I lift, I mean I squat 200 lbs, deadlift 265 and so on. I also eat per macro allotment. I follow macros to keep in top performance shape. <\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>What is one life hack you would like to share with the world? (Don’t have anything revolutionary? No prob. This could be some simple or quirky thing that you do or habit you have that you have to do to be your best.)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nI’m pretty quirky and have so many random facts and pieces of irrelevant information but I can never come up with anything on the spot. It’s situational. Ummm there isn’t a cheat code for everything but it doesn’t hurt to try. <\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>What is your favorite song right now that gets you pumped every time either to work out or play games, and why?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\n\nOh man. There are so many. I’m listening to a lot of Nordic metal but also you can’t go wrong with any 80s jams. <\/p>\n<p>\n\n<b>Anything else?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\n\nWell, I definitely don’t resemble the gamer stereotype. I’m a former bank manager, ranch wrangler, and rodeo queen. I have calluses and black toenails but I can hang in Halo 4. I’m also a HUGE Harry Potter book nerd. I named my houseplant Pomona (Professor Sprout). I’m actually a cat person but I have two dogs (four currently because my grandma's dog and my sister's dog are living at my house) and two cats.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

              "text": "<p>In the lightning round, Aileen reveals her favorite city in the US besides the one she lives in. (Las Vegas). She also shares her childhood nickname (Bobba), what she likes to listen to on walks (music), and her preference between iOS and Android (Android). Her spirit animal is a dachshund because they’re both stubborn and don't like to be told what to do. (And yes, dachshunds are ‘wiener dogs’, hahahaha, wiener, let’s move on.)\n <\/p><p>\nBefore joining goodr, Aileen was the director of inventory planning at another startup. When she saw the job posting at goodr, she was super motivated to be a part of the culture. She prepared for each stage of the interview process as if it were a marathon. And when she got the job offer, she finally crossed that finish line! Which turned out to be another starting line. (Surprise, Aileen!!! The end is the beginning!!! Time is a circle!!! Life is a snake eating its own tail!!! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!)\n <\/p><p>\nAileen’s lame title is Head of Operations. Her real title is Profit Prophet (named by Lily Hanson, goodr’s best copywriter and extremely hot super genius, who is definitely NOT writing this goodrTIMES blog.) Aileen can optimize any type of bottlenecks that we encounter in the business. Basically, the flock plans and automates whatever they can.\n <\/p><p>\nOn a high level, the Crystal Ballers plan inventory, track shipments, manage and maintain systems. Their flock values are reliability and learning. Reliability is important because you work with so many different people. You have to be dependable so that everything stays in motion. Learning is important because we're always improving at goodr. We always examine our mistakes and wins, so we can scale, and continue improving as time goes on.\n <\/p><p>\nUnder the inventory management umbrella, Crystal Ballers has Aja as buyer and planner. She handles everything and anything that relates to inventory. She makes sure we always have the right amount of product at the right time and in the right places. We have several different sales channels, and want to make sure they’re all taken care of. \n <\/p><p>\nFor global logistics, the team has an analyst that will be handling everything to get our shipments from point A to point B. For data and analytics, the Ballers act as a transformation machine, turning information into a story that helps you understand that info. And finally, for systems and processes, the flock is implementing an ERP. (No, not AARP, ERP, pay attention!) This system will help us organize all of our information into one centralized location. (Like how when kids “clean” their room, they just shove everything in the closet! Or maybe not. This analogy is not Aileen-approved.)\n <\/p><p>\nForecasting is important, as you may have deduced from the name “Crystal Ballers.” It helps the flock plan for the future, by managing cash flow, and reducing unnecessary costs. (Uh-oh. Hope that doesn’t mean getting rid of free limo service for the copywriters! That is an extremely necessary expense, especially for A-list celebrity Lily Hanson.)  Ultimately, goodr strives to achieve goals without over stretching ourselves as a brand. We find balance between risk and growth by being prepared.\n <\/p><p>\nAs a brand growing faster than Sonic the Hedgehog after 97 espressos, cash flow is important. If we're not forecasting correctly, we end up with too much product, and that money is basically dead. And if we don't have enough product, we're losing money. It’s a juggling act. That explains why every morning, Aileen juggles flaming torches for two hours, or maybe she doesn’t, whatever, chill out, don’t fact-check this.\n <\/p><p>\nSome products sell out surprisingly quickly. For example, the 2021 Valentine’s Day sunglasses, “Carl's Got A Candy Heart On,” greatly exceeded expectations. They were supposed to last two weeks, but instead, they sold out in three days. When the Crystal Ballers have no history with a product, it’s difficult to predict the sellout timeline, so they make educated guesses. In the end, the episode taught them a valuable lesson: Never underestimate a heart on.\n <\/p><p>\nWhen Aileen first arrived at goodr, the systems looked like separate puzzle pieces that didn’t fit together well. Everyone was pulling information from different places and didn't know which place to trust. Now the puzzle is nicely pieced together, and everything is connected properly. There’s no more licking our fingers and putting them in the air to guess things. (And there’s no more licking our fingers and putting them in people’s ears. Our CEO, Carl the Flamingo went through a “Wet Willy” phase, and it was harrowing.)\n <\/p><p>\nIt takes one year to plan and implement an ERP, possibly longer, because you keep discovering more intricacies about the business. If you're in project management, you have critical paths. Finance and accounting portions need to sign off. There are things in the operational world that can shift a bit, but if certain financial pieces are broken, then everything falls apart. And they're stuck with the paperwork and reconciliation, which is the opposite of what we want to do. Everyone wants things to happen quickly, but it always costs more and takes longer. (So, stop bitching and moaning about George R.R. Martin taking a decade to write The Winds of Winter, nerds! There are a million other fantasy books out there!!! LEAVE!!!! GEORGE!!!! ALONE!!!!)\n <\/p><p>\nOps sits between the Product and DC teams. Product works directly with the vendor. Ops also works with the vendor, but at a different capacity. Their job is to make sure that we get products produced in time, purchase the right quantities, and get them here on time. Also, they make sure the DC knows we have shipments coming, or else they're going to be like, “WTF? Why’s this container sitting on our dock?” Really, Crystal Ballers are the communicators, the glue between our teams. Hug them at your own risk.\n<\/p>",

              "text": "<p>Once goodrs are done being produced at the factory, the Ballers work with our freight forwarder to book a vessel. (Pro-tip: Do NOT book vessels named “Titanic.”) The boats pick up products at the factory door, make sure they’re packed in a big container and transport it to port. In 30 to 45 days, the freight arrives at The Lagoon (goodr’s offices plus warehouse in Los Angeles.) The Ballers coordinate with the freight forwarder to estimate the arrival date, then notify the DC, who receives the shipment, puts it on our shelves, and ships it to you. (Arguably, this process is just as magical as the miracle of childbirth. Maybe more so.)\n <\/p><p>\nWhat are the three most important ops metrics? Aileen says: 1) Productivity, a versatile metric to understand how well areas are performing compared to the norm. 2) Inventory, which helps project the amount of weeks we have left on hand. And 3) Operating costs, which includes costs related to transportation and inventory equipment. It’s important to understand cost and identify areas of improvement for efficiency. (Like, for example, how Family Matters got rid of that boring middle child Judy character and made Steve Urkel a main character. Very efficient for comedy.)\n <\/p><p>\nFor anyone starting out in operations, Aileen recommends looking at productivity from all angles, such as profitability and creating the runway. “Don't run out of product,” she commands, while juggling flaming torches. “DON’T RUN OUT OF PRODUCT.” As far as ops processes go, the Profit Prophet is most proud of the productivity index. It gauges how well a specific style is doing compared to everything else.\n <\/p><p>\nFor example, take Bosley’s Basset Hound Dreams. (Long live the King.) “Those are so amazing, right?” says Aileen. “Is it the silhouette? Is it the color? Is it how it's displayed on the website? There are a variety of different things that you can look at and then apply that to future launches by taking little tidbits from those attributes that you see from your best sellers and then...plan them into your future line.”\n <\/p><p>\nLast year, the shadowy cabal behind goodr realized we should keep top sellers in line, and that we don't have an all black pair of every model. So, we launched the Blackout series last February. But, Aileen says, if we had a productivity index, we would’ve noticed earlier: “Hey, all-black sunglasses kills. We should have all-black everything.”\n <\/p><p>\nAs an Enneagram type 8 personality (The Challenger), with a wing nine (The Diplomat), Aileen loves a good challenge. It grants opportunities to take on big plans and learn things along the way. Nothing's ever the same in the span of days, weeks, months or even years. She helps make people's lives easier, and rack up more accomplishments. The best ops people in the world are super creative, because they have to be to excel. (Especially when transforming data FROM Excel. Do YOU excel at Excel? Or do you excel at being an incel? The choice is yours.)\n <\/p><p>\n<b>Here’s Aileen’s three cheat codes for anyone in the ops space:<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n<b>1.<\/b> There is always a way, no matter what. Just keep pushing through.<\/p><p>\n<b>2.<\/b> Garbage in, garbage out. For those computer science folks. <\/p><p>\n<b>3.<\/b> Microsoft Excel.\n <\/p><p>\nThat’s it for this week, kids!

This literally has nothing to do with CULTURE goodr. What the hell?! That’s not even from a season 3, or the sixth episode. That’s the season finale of season four of The Office. One of these days we promise we’ll get our sh*t together. \n<\/p><p>\nIn season 3, episode 6 of CULTURE goodr, Shaun and Stephen do a deep dive on our HR team, AKA the Ministry of Culture. We know at most companies people involuntarily hiss like feral cats at the mere mention of HR, or they scatter to their cubicles like cockroaches avoiding sunlight. Not here though! Fun fact: we don’t even have cubicles. We’re proud to say our HR department is like your favorite sweater: warm, fuzzy, and dependable. And we’re not just saying that because they can technically fire us. This flock’s areas of focus are human resources (so meta!), performance, experience, connection, and goodr.OS. Our Chief of Flamingos, Nicole, joins the pod to explain the importance of setting the tone at goodr, supporting individual growth, creating connection, and making sure we're all having fun!!\n<\/p>\n<div id=\"buzzsprout-player-8677646\"><\/div>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/www.buzzsprout.com\/1056625\/8677646-s03e06-human-resources-feeling-toasty-warm-in-the-sun-of-goodr-s-ecosystem.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-8677646&player=small\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>",

In the lightning round, we learn that Nicole has never fallen victim to the heinous fashion crime of wearing socks with sandals out in public. She also knows that waffles are superior to pancakes. (Don’t @ us, deep down you know it’s the GD truth). She also reveals that her spirit animal is a wolf. She describes them as grounded and spiritual, and while we’ve never personally witnessed her howling at the moon, we’d say this is an accurate choice.\n <\/p><p>\nPrior to joining goodr, Nicole worked in the fitness industry for 15 years. (This is on the DL, but rumor has it she was a world-class Savate champion once upon a time. Translation: she is a complete badass. But we digress...) Around the time goodr was launching, she met and became friends with Stephen. Two years later she saw his Facebook post asking if anyone would be interested in working in goodr’s Distribution Center, and the rest is history! Over the years her role has evolved and she is now our official Chief of the Flamingos (that’s Head of Culture and HR in lame-man’s terms). \n <\/p>",

              "text": "On a high level, the Ministry of Culture hires, onboards, and supports goodr staff and culture. Their flock values are integrity and connection. Integrity is paramount because trust is everything in an organization and connection quite simply is how we stay connected to each other, to the brand, to our lives, to fun, to authenticity! All of which are super important to us here at goodr.\n <p>\nBe sure to check out the episode for all the details on how Nicole and her term ensure that the hiring process is fun, authentic, and inclusive. (Hint: we encourage you to fly your freak flag high! But maybe just don’t come to your interview high?) Do we really make you submit a drawing of a pirate fighting an octopus?! Or is that just an urban legend? Is it really OK for you to refer to yourself as “100% that bitch” in your cover letter?! Is it really “OK to not be OK” here?! We’ll get to those glamorous topics as well as the unsexy topics you desperately want to know about, for example: What happens if you f*ck up on the job? Or you aren’t a great culture fit? And seriously, why do most HR departments suck?! Listen to find out!\n <\/p><p>\nWe can’t leave without hooking you up with <b>Nicole’s top three cheat codes for anyone in HR:<\/b>\n <\/p><p>\n<b>1.<\/b> Lead with curiosity. Super important.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>2.<\/b> You don't know everything. Come to conversations\/situations\/issues with that curiosity, knowing you don't know everything. Jumping to an assumption or a conclusion is deadly.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>3.<\/b> Always look for ways to improve and grow. That's my big thing. I always want to keep growing, improving. You're never done.\n <\/p><p>\nThat’s all we got ‘til next time! And remember, it’s always a good idea to ply your HR rep with See’s caramel patties, chocolate chip cookies, and vodka.

Spillman is joined by musical guest, Elvis Costello, because evidently not anyone can be a musical guest. In the cold open, John Belushi and Gilda Radner fret that Spillman won’t be able to --- ahhhhhh crap-burger! That’s season 3, episode 8 of Saturday Night Live! (Yes, episode 7, not 8, and yes, a non-celebrity 80-year-old woman hosted SNL once, google it.) Let’s try again.\n<\/p><p>\nOn season 3, episode 7 of CULTURE goodr, Shaun and Stephen do a deep dive on the Puppet Masters (aka Project Managers). This year (2021, for you time travelers), goodr is launching 120 sunglasses and over 40 pieces of apparel, plus throwing 6 major virtual and live events, PLUS opening an experiential retail shop on Abbot Kinney! (Yes, that’s really happening, and it looks AMAZING.) Believe it or not, 2022 will be an even BIGGER year, so goodr needs a team of bomb project managers pulling the strings.\n<\/p>\n<div id=\"buzzsprout-player-8778760\"><\/div>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/www.buzzsprout.com\/1056625\/8778760-s03e07-project-managers-staying-safe-with-the-controlled-burn-in-goodr-s-ecosystem.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-8778760&player=small\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>",

She prefers dine-in to delivery, sweaters to hoodies, and her spirit animal is a panda. Before joining goodr, she held a variety of jobs, ranging from elementary school teacher to magazine editor to wedding photographer. (Psshh. The real money is in divorce photography.)\n <\/p><p>\nThe Puppet Masters are “the controlled burn” at goodr, helping other flocks plan, organize, and execute projects. Without them, launches and events would spiral into chaos and disaster, like Khaleesi’s rampage at King’s Landing. (AND season 8 of Game of Thrones, HA.)  Hanssie’s real title is Mother of Dragons, and her lame title is Lead Project Manager. “I will burn things down if I have to,” she says. We’re scared of her.\n <\/p><p>\nAt goodr, we’re able to say yes to kickass projects on short timelines because of the Puppet Masters’ core values: Organization and accountability. Since they work with all the different flocks, there’s never a dull moment. They’re constantly solving problems -- like discovering a trade show booth didn’t make it to New Jersey 18 hours before the event starts -- and that requires creativity. Luckily, everyone is super organized, especially Hanssie, who is also goodr’s STD Coach -- whoops! We mean GTD Coach. GTD stands for Getting Things Done, a work-life management system that goodr employees practice, or Hanssie will burn them like Scorpion’s fatality in Mortal Kombat.\n<\/p>",

              "text": "<p>Carl’s Flight Plan is the planned route of a launch. Each quarter, all employees are encouraged to pitch ideas at Pitchapalooza. The chosen pitches get slotted into our 58-week launch calendar. Each one gets a flight plan, which contains about 140 tasks from pitch to live. To make sure all tasks are on time, the Puppet Masters use a red flag protocol system. 5 red flags indicate a launch will be delayed, forcing goodr to course correct. 10 red flags indicate we will panic, get drunk, go mad, playing real-life Hunger Games in The Lagoon, while SDL sits atop a golden throne, cackling with glee.\n <\/p><p>\nHanssie says her biggest triumph is throwing goodrSTOCK during the pandemic. goodrSTOCK is the quarterly all-company summit dedicated to connection, information and having fun. When COVID hit, we were unable to meetup in person, so the PMs pivoted and threw awesome virtual events. (Sadly, we couldn't do the traditional Spit in Each Other’s Mouths contest, but fingers crossed for the IRL goodrstock 14 this July!!!!!)\n <\/p><p>\nEvery launch has its own Slack channel with a link to the deck, which makes it easier to track things down. On Wrecking Ball Wednesdays, The PMs go through all projects with a fine tooth comb, looking for overdue deliverables or upcoming deliverables. They make fun a priority, although their job involves doing things that don’t sound fun, like processes, spreadsheets, audits, and keeping people accountable. Hanssie says her biggest fuck-up is not hiring an Asana coach earlier to improve the automation.\n <\/p><p>\nAaaaand here’s Hanssie’s cheat codes for Puppet Masters \/ Project Managers:\n <\/p><p>\n<b>1.<\/b>“Anything can be changed and probably will be, even if you don't have your own demolition man. So make sure you're flexible and you have a sense of humor.<br><br>\n<b>2.<\/b>“Banging your head against the wall burns 150 calories an hour, and crying burns 78. So if you do both of them at the same time, you maximize those benefits -- the PM workout plan. That’s how we stay in shape.”<br><br>\n<b>3.<\/b>“Sense of humor. If you don’t have one, get one.”\n <\/p><p>\nThat’s it for this week. Remember, nothing you do is your own choice. There’s no such thing as free will. The Puppet Masters are always pulling the strings.\n<\/p>\n<hr>\nIf you haven’t subscribed to our <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttps:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/the-culture-goodr-podcast%E2%80%9D\">email list<\/a>, do that now to make sure you don’t miss out on any upcoming episodes of CULTURE goodr.\n<p><\/p><p>\nHow about a joyful scroll through the <a rel=\"”nofollow”\" href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/culturegoodr\/%E2%80%9D\">@culturegoodr<\/a> Instagram?

              "text": "When I was first asked to write this piece about ‘being a beast,’ I figured it would be simple, because I’ve heard this word used to describe me for as long as I can remember. But then I started to think... What the hell is a beast? Have I been called this because I impress people as an athlete? Or is it because I have not gone more than two days without training in... ever? Or maybe it’s because I was an MMA fighter and I just scare the shit out of people? I honestly had no idea until I really thought about it, but I think I have it figured out.\n<p><\/p><p>\nBy my definition, to be a ‘beast’ in an athletic sense, you have to be willing to push your limits beyond what an average human would consider safe. You have to know exactly what you want to achieve physically, and be able to get yourself there mentally. You need to accept the idea that injury is likely, and know that if you lose you are probably NOT going to be okay. So pretty much, you have to be a complete psycho, and own it. And now I get it, because thaaaaaat’s me!\n<\/p><p>\nI look back on many of the things I have done in my life, and I often question my mental sanity. I spent the vast majority of my childhood in the gym, and I cannot remember complaining about it a single time. From the age of 3 to 16, I spent an average of 7 hours daily, training gymnastics. I only went to school for 4 hours a day, where I had maybeeee five good friends in total over the span of 13 years. I never stayed for lunch, I didn’t even know what PE was because I never had to take it. Instead, I was injured every other month with some sort of cast on my body. I got yelled at for hours a day being told I wasn’t performing well enough. I ate fast food for every meal because it’s all I had time for. I did homework from 9pm to at least midnight every single day, only to go through it all again the next morning. I conditioned with my coaches to the point of tears almost daily. I was a child who did not have a childhood. And I LOVED IT!\n<\/p><p>\nFast forward to 16 years old after a career-ending hand injury, here is a girl who grew up way too fast, and all she had ever known was taken away from her. I was lost as fuck; I had WAY too much time on my hands, no real friends at school... and now I had to take PE?? WTF is that?! Long story short, it was my bright idea to quit eating for the next four years, and completely throw away the impressive and strong body I had worked hard for my entire life up until this point.<\/p>",

In fact, I would get on the elliptical or treadmill for a minimum of 2 hours a day, oftentimes passing out. I got kicked out of two different gyms for constantly passing out on their equipment and putting myself in danger. Which now that I think about it, might be the most ridiculous thing ever. But again... Psycho.<p><\/p><p>\n\nAnyhow, my selfish ass finally got over myself and started eating again like a normal human after a year away from the toxic life I had created for myself. I moved to Europe for a year, and there I was reminded of what my life could, and should be. It was time to buckle down and figure out what I wanted to make of myself, knowing that once I nailed it down, I would do WHATEVER it took to get there. So, don’t ask me how, but becoming a Professional MMA Fighter was that thing!<\/p>",

Second, I broke my hand on a girl's face in the first round, then proceeded to knock her out in the second round with that same hand. Somewhere in the mix there was a broken nose, a few broken fingers, a fucked up back and shoulder, and then the final straw... a broken ankle three days before my final fight in Kansas CIty for Invicta. I would love somebody to tell me why it took 4 years and over 10 serious injuries to realize that MMA fighting was not the right career choice for me, but whatever. Maybe I was hit in the head too many times to figure my shit out before my first loss. Live and ya learn. But again... PSYCHO.",

I still train five hours a day, but I am also pursuing my full-time career in real estate development. I still have a 6 pack and am stronger than ever, but I am not 95 pounds and starving myself to death, passing out on cardio machines. Instead I am 160 pounds of muscle, and I enjoy sprinkling donuts and cheeseburgers in with my chicken and broccoli. I am happy and healthy, and I can now look back on the entirety of my life and trace exactly how I got to where I am today. I am confident in myself and have finally gotten to the place where I can honestly say that I do not regret any of the decisions I made in my past. No matter how unhealthy or stupid, today I FEEL like a beast. Still sometimes injured, often pushing boundaries beyond what is considered ‘safe’ by the general public, definitely a little bit psycho, but most importantly, a lot of bit motivated and mentally strong.

She tricks Brenda into helping her make a documentary about the other students at West Beverly. Idiot student (uhh we meant to say “naive,” yeah “naive”) Brenda, agrees to be interviewed, not realizing that the show will twist and edit her words out of context so that it looks like she’s basically calling out all of her best friends on national television for being a bunch of dumb, spoiled, promiscuous brats (among other things). When in reality, she was babbling on about how truly amazing they all are. Aww, that really gets us in the feels. Oh yeah, Steve also gets a legacy key to the high school, but no one cares about Steve. Sorry Steve. Dangit. Looks like we got so caught up in the drama at West Beverly that we screwed up again! Sorry about that. (Also, we desperately want to know if you are team Kelly or team Brenda when it comes to Dylan McKay. Please slide into our DMs.) Speaking of Kellys...\n<\/p><p>\nKelley is our Octovations flock leader\/ringmaster. In season 3, episode 8 of CULTURE goodr, Shaun and Stephen do a deep dive on the Octovations Team (aka Activations). We don’t know if you know this, but goodr is not a “lifestyle brand” -- it’s an active eyewear brand. We make fun, functional, fashionable, ‘ffordable sunglasses for athletes. We don’t want to talk to everyone like giant “lifestyle brands”!!! We want to create connection and hype while building community so that we have rabid, wonderful customers and fans that all feel connected to us. That’s where our Octovations team comes in. \n<\/p>\n<div id=\"buzzsprout-player-8789995\"><\/div>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/www.buzzsprout.com\/1056625\/8789995-s03e08-activations-snacking-on-the-guano-of-goodr-s-ecosystem.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-8789995&player=small\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>",

(We swear she was only doing that for work, not because it’s like a hobby or anything like that.) We also learned that she hasn’t sneezed in like a week, so you can probably sit next to her safely without risk of spray-age, but she may show you pictures of her spirit animal (her dog Tuna), or try to talk to you about The Wonder Years. J\/K, she has literally never done that when we’ve had the pleasure of hanging with her. Before joining goodr, she worked at Paramount Pictures and Media. She oversaw all of their TV\/digital outdoor planning for all domestic releases. A couple of years ago she was coaching a marathon team with NutriBullet, where she met Steven. Coincidentally, that's also where the inception for goodr took place! \n <\/p><p>\nSo, Octovations... We obviously love Krakens here at goodr and there's eight team members on the Activations team, so “octo” just makes sense! They have their tentacles, errr hands, in a lot of different things. Their two core values are preparation and connection, and their primary objective is to create connection with our different communities. Currently on the team, we have five community managers who oversee our different verticals and we have our cabana lead. (We will be opening up a new Cabana location on Abbot Kinney soooon. It is going to be LEGIT.) We also have our social strategist on the team who works super closely with all of our community managers on the social side of things. Their official areas of focus are connection, expertise, cohesion, and hype. \n <\/p><p>\nBut how do they make this magic happen?!<br>\nBe sure to check out the episode to find out!! \n<\/p>",

Luckily I did very well with surgery and am already on the mend! Pretty soon, I’ll be able to run and play like all the other puppies. I’m a 7 month old female boxer mix and I currently weigh about 30 pounds. I have the sweetest brown eyes and ears that are constantly flopping around. I’m a happy-go-lucky and playful lady. I love playing with toys and hanging out with my human foster brother. I’m so excited to meet my new family!

Jane throws Sydney out of her apartment AND fires her (sisterly love, aww). Chris tells Sydney's parole officer AND Jane that Sydney is harassing HIM, and threatens to send her back to the asylum if she won’t make filthy whoopie with him. Crap. That’s describing Melrose Place. We’re starting to think that Aaron Spelling’s ghost is messaging us subliminally in our sleep. Sorry about that! We’ll get to CULTURE goodr right now...<br><br>\n \nIn season 3, episode 9 of CULTURE goodr, Shaun and Stephen do a deep dive on the Storysellers (or Sales Team if you want to be like that!!) A super unique thing about our sales team here at goodr is that they earn no commission. That’s because goodr is a “we” vs. “I” company that celebrates the work over the results. We have a lot of amazing teams at goodr who come together to make the magic of goodr happen. It’s not just up to sales for us to be successful.

She identifies as being of the House Gryffindor, but we don’t know if she’s really into larping. The fact that she is Gryffindor (courage, determination, basic goodness, etc.) ties in perfectly with her spirit animal, a Golden Eagle. The Golden Eagle is a perfect choice, as soaring and moving past hard situations just resonates with Alli. She’d probably ride one to play Quidditch. When pressed, she also admits her spirit animal may be a weasel but doesn’t elaborate. We’ll have to get back to you on that.<br><br>\n \nAlli has actually known founders Stephen and Keri since she was a small child. When they posted on social media looking for someone to work in the Distribution Center, Alli responded, and the rest is history!! She packed up and moved from Colorado to Los Angeles to fill the role, and her path led her to becoming head of sales. (It hasn’t quite led to her getting goodrs in the Harry Potter gift shop in the Scotland airport yet, but baby steps.)\n<\/p>",

              "text": "<p>Alli explains how the sales team structure at goodr is unconventional. At many companies, sales teams have a very linear structure,  with defined territories, and paid commission. But here at goodr, our sales department is in a pod system, in more of a circular shape. We believe in people being in the right roles, not people being assigned to a geographical territory. So for example, if someone is really good at doing co-brands, Alli would want them to lead the co-brand side of our business. If someone is great at elevating key accounts, that person should be focused on key accounts, regardless of where they are geographically. We're really focused on roles and making sure that people are in the right role in helping our retailers or our B2B partners. At the very baseline goodr sells sunglasses. The Storysellers focus on storytelling, growth, connection, ambassadors, and cohesion. In order to grow, you have to expand your brand. You need risk-taking and community to do that and those are the Storysellers’ values.<br><br>\n \nBe sure to tune into the episode to find out what it takes to become a goodr retailer, why feeling the brand is super important, what sets us apart from other brands in the retail space, the other bizarre places Alli would like to see goodrs being sold, and lots more. <br><br>\n \nAnd of course, this wouldn’t be complete without Alli’s three cheat codes for anyone in the sales space:<br><br>\n \n<b>1.<\/b>“Listen.”<br><br>\n<b>2.<\/b>“Listen.”<br><br>\n<b>3.<\/b>“Always be closing (ABC).  If all else fails, tell a drunk Limerick, listen, and then ABC.” <br><br>\n \nSo yeah, always be closing. (Your undies drawer, the dishwasher, your laptop, the front door, your fly, your banking app, the oven...) We’ll be back again with a new episode next week!!\n<\/p>\n<hr>\nIf you haven’t subscribed to our <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttps:\/\/goodr.com\/blogs\/goodrtimes\/the-culture-goodr-podcast%E2%80%9D\">email list<\/a>, do that now to make sure you don’t miss out on any upcoming episodes of CULTURE goodr.\n<p><\/p><p>\nHow about a joyful scroll through the <a rel=\"”nofollow”\" href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/culturegoodr\/%E2%80%9D\">@culturegoodr<\/a> Instagram?

Meanwhile, Carl’s son Eddie wants to date an “easy” gal named Vonda. However, nosy neighbor Steve Urkel teaches her that the key to attracting partners isn’t opening your legs -- it’s opening your heart. Wait a second...gosh darn it! This isn’t s03e10 of CULTURE goodr! It’s s03e10 of Family Matters! (Did we do thaaat?) Let’s try this again.\n  <br><br>\nIn season 3, episode 10 of CULTURE goodr, Shaun and Stephen do a deep dive on the Fungineers (aka Product Team). The first product goodr created was The OGs, and they were a hit. But we didn’t want to be a one-hit wonder, like Vanilla Ice. (Did YOU listen to the five albums he made after “Ice Ice Baby?” Didn’t think so.) When planning our second model, we created a filter called the four F's: Fun, Fashionable, functional, and ‘ffordable. Every product must speak to the four F's before getting greenlit.\n <br><br>\nFlock Leader Mountain (there was already a “Mike” at goodr, so he goes by his last name, “Mountain”) joins the pod to talk about his department. But first, he shares a little info about himself: He prefers card games to board games, his favorite ice cream flavor is pistachio, and his spirit animal is a dolphin. Before joining goodr, he worked in the product world at Eastern and Mad Dog Athletics, plus played a memorable role on seasons 4-8 of Game of Thrones.

They’re responsible for getting products here on time, at spec, and at the target cost in order to make the whole business formula work. Then, once they arrive, they run QC (Quality Control) to make sure they’re absolutely perfect. (Justt lyike this fyne tooned kopy!)<br><br>\n \nThe Fungineers’s areas of focus are development, quality, regulations, sustainability and sourcing (managing a reliable network for suppliers). There are two product managers on the team: Brian covers eyewear, and Marissa handles everything else. Plus,  there’s Carlos, the QC specialist and 3D designer. Together, they evaluate quality, growth, innovation, efficiency and the processes by which goodr creates products. In order to constantly make more cool sh*t, goodr has to constantly be more efficient. (That’s why we fired eight two-armed copywriters, and hired one eight-armed copywriter. Genius.)\n <br><br>\nHow do goodrs go from ideas to glasses on faces? We’re glad you asked! At our quarterly event, Pitchaplooza, goodr employees pitch concepts. Once a core idea is chosen, tech packs are created. They’re the cornerstone of this process. Once the colors and designs are selected, we fill out the elaborate tech packs. Mountain explains that this isn’t easy -- sometimes there are 25 different looks we narrow down to 6. Once the deets are finalized, the Fungineers make sure Operations has everything they need to cut that production order: the item info, dimensions, cost, vendor info, etc. A couple months later, the product arrives via Loch Ness Monster,, we QC it, and it's out the door.\n<\/p>",

Mountain says there’s a three-part process for quality control: First, at the factories, where we’ve traveled to teach how them to QC; second, the Fungineers do QC once it arrives at the goodr Lagoon; and third, a third party does an audit for really important production runs when we can’t be there ourselves. Stephen notes that one of goodr’s mottos is “done is better than perfect...dot dot dot...except for the physical product, because if it arrives and it’s not perfect, we’re f***ed.”\n \nAfter discussing the hurdles of manufacturing in the U.S. vs. China, and creating recycled goodrs (very simple issues, super easy problems to solve), Mountain reveals the three weirdest things we’ve created: The monocle, the eclipse glasses, and (the new) Baby Carl. Ultimately, Mountain doesn’t believe goodr is a product company. He believes goodr is a culture company, and the products support the culture.<br><br>\n \nIn closing, Mountain offers three cheat codes for anybody in the product space: <br><br>\n\n<strong>1.<\/strong> Always have someone on a call with your vendors who can jump in and make sure they get the message. <br><br>\n\n<strong>2.<\/strong> If it can't be replicated in production with real consistency, then don't show it to anybody. <br><br>\n\n<strong>3.<\/strong> It's best to work with multiple vendors on projects and have dual paths to success, in case they disappoint you.<br><br>\n \nWe’ll return with a new ep next week!

Castillo wants to take away his badge, but Crockett convinces him not to. They then use the wayward officer to locate the source of pure cocaine found on one of the prostitutes, a girl the crooked cop just happens to be in love with. Woah woah woah, where the heck is Tubbs?! And also, we’re sure this is no surprise, but we accidentally messed up again. Fine, it wasn’t an accident. Whatever. This was S3 Ep 11 of Miami Vice. Let’s get to S3 Ep 11 of CULTURE goodr. (Sorry, not sorry.)\n <br><br>\nIn season 3, episode 11 of CULTURE goodr, Shaun and Stephen do a deep dive on the Department of Dreams (aka our Copy and Content Team). From here on out we’ll just lovingly refer to them as Dreams. \n  <br><br>\nOne of the super unique and interesting things about goodr is that we basically have an entire in-house production company here! We have everything from producers, props directors, editors, costumes to copywriters. And not to brag or anything, but the end result is that our content is NEXT LEVEL!!! Dreams gets to create content for five verticals: RUN, BEAST, BIKE, GAME, and GOLF. Plus they create content for the overall goodr brand plus CULTURE, and loads of internal stuff. We have over one hundred product launches every year. If you think about it, that is a LOT of content, and a lot of hard work, blood, sweat and unicorn tears goes into making it happen! We sort of have always said, goodr is like a marketing agency that just happens to sell sunglasses.\n<\/p><div id=\"buzzsprout-player-8934449\"><\/div>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/www.buzzsprout.com\/1056625\/8934449-s03e11-content-challenging-the-status-quo-to-outgoodr-goodr.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-8934449&player=small\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>",

Just so you know, she is a freaking amazing dancer and all-around creative genius (And I swear I am not just saying that because she is my flock leader. HI KERI!!!) She is a dog person, but has a feline soulmate, a tres ‘dorbs fat cat named Mark Maron. She has three spirit animals, a dolphin, a Basset Hound, and a snail. She knows that HBO is way better than Netflix or YouTube. We think that all proves that you should listen to her.\n  <br><br>\nSo, something else amusing about Keri, is that she and Stephen used to date. Oooooh, busted, si-tatiiion!!! (Please excuse us, we have been dying to say that since 1990, after it became passe in 1989.) For a long time she was a crackerjack VP of well, everything here at goodr! She was packing, shipping, doing customer service, bookkeeping, acting as an informant for the FBI...until she landed in her current position of Chief Dreams Orchestrator (or Head of Content if you want to be boring.)\n <br><br>\nThe Dream’s areas of focus are studio, copy, dream, cohesion, and identity. Studio is the photo and video production team. Copy is copywriting. Dream is where we make time and space for dreaming BIG, and challenging the status quo (or status the quo challenge as it is now known at goodr.) Cohesion is how we communicate and connect with the other flocks. And identity is just keeping our content brand standards up to date, because low standards are reserved for Carl's Tinder swipes.<\/p>",

The goodr brand and design team. Are any of the members of the goodr Illuminati members of the real Illuminati? We can’t say. But it would be the perfect cover. The Illuminati are prolific creators at goodr, from content to product to social to web to wall graphics to t-shirts to sunglasses. Mike, the Flock Leader, joins the pod to explain how to keep your integrity and stay on brand without getting stale. While creating, the Illuminati focuses on being fun and authentic, rather than being “cool” and liked. When you show up with energy and authenticity, everything else will take care of itself.\n <br><br>\nIn the lightning round, Mike says that he loves a good sleep and is a big ASMR fan. He prefers pens to pencils, stacks toilet paper rolls over, not under, and his spirit animal is a red panda. Stephen and Mike go way back.

They strive to create connection and energy around the brand through next level designs and amazing partnerships (like Warner Brothers, The Rolling Stones & Pabst Blue Ribbon!). The team’s core values are resiliency and transparency. To avoid stagnation, we have to take risks. Failure is inevitable. When it happens, we learn from it, and come back stronger.

They also drive the launch aesthetics and overall vision. If you’re on The Illuminati, you get to work on the product and the marketing. Marketing is primarily digital, and that medium is a blank canvas. No constraints. On the flip products have a ton of limitations. Graphic application processes can only do so much. You can only have certain color ways and certain styles. A pair of sunglasses doesn’t have much real estate. How do you tell a story in half an inch?

And she was a gosh dang bully.<\/p>\n<p>Whoever came up with the Presidential Fitness Test should be fired (it was probably Mrs. Johnson). Why is running a mile, doing sit ups, pushups, and measuring how far you can stretch an indicator of your physical health at age seven?! I’ll spare you the gory details of my first ever shame-filled attempt, but let’s just say my growing seven-year-old body ran the mile in 14 minutes. Not bad, eh? Wrong. Once finished, I was met with mean Mrs. Johnson, stomping over to me waving her stopwatch in the air. She got right in my sweaty, pudgy face and barked, “14 minutes? I could walk a mile in 14 minutes, you run like you have a piano on your back!”<\/p>\n<p>This was the last straw for me, I had had enough of this cantankerous bitch. Gym class is supposed to be fun! A refuge for kids like me who can’t stand math class, and wish they still had nap time! So, filled with rage about the injustice I was enduring for 50 minutes every day, I rehearsed with my fiercely protective mother what I was going to say to Mrs. Johnson. The following day, hands sweaty with nerves and indignation, I marched up to Mrs. Johnson and told her, in front of the entire class, that she is the teacher and I’m the kid and it’s her job to make gym class fun, but instead, she makes the class feel bad about themselves and that’s not what teachers are supposed to do. (Man, sometimes I wish my 31-year-old self had the balls my seven-year-old self did.)<\/p>",

In a lot of ways, it was a place for me to put all the jokes I would write while running. But it has become something so much more than that. It’s a place where a “runner” is defined as anyone who laces up their shoes and goes for a run. Sometimes I’ll write jokes, sometimes I’ll spill my guts, and sometimes I’ll just write what I need to hear that day. The best surprise always comes when it’s what everyone else needed that day too.<\/p>\n<p>And look, I am by no means a “good” runner (what even is a “good” runner, anyway?). I run because I love it, I don’t pay much attention to my time, and I will probably never win a race. I run because it’s FUN, and if it ever makes me feel bad like Mrs. Johnson did, I’ll stop (I probably won’t). But like, in the end, do I belong as much as the next runner? Yup. And you do too.<\/p>",

But let’s get real, have you ever noticed the phenomenon amongst runners that when you’re not running, all talk is about running? And when you are running, all you want to talk about is, well, anything but running? If you haven’t noticed this before, and I just blew your dang mind, you’re welcome. But if you know what I’m talking about, you know this is one aspect of running that makes the sport so special.<\/p>\n<p>When I first started hanging out in the running community in NYC, I went to a meet-up at a bar with the new team I had joined. I dressed up, put make-up on (a big deal for me), and was so pumped to learn all about these new people in my life. I got to the bar, grabbed a drink, and sidled up to some of the ladies on the team.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I am a steady back-of-the-pack runner, and I am used to being dropped pretty much within the first five minutes of any workout. When my running friends run with me now, it is usually because they have already gotten their run in and are doing me a favor. I am 100% okay with the favor, and my friends have never made me feel less than because I cannot return it.<\/p>",

I guess it depends on what you define as “fun.” Buzz Burrell and Peter Bawkin, the co-founders\/co-creators of the Fastest Known Time website would probably say both. They founded the website and coined the term FKT after setting records on the John Muir Trail in 2000 and the Colorado Trail a year prior. The site started as a proboard forum where anyone could submit a route and post his or her time and then others would follow suit if they were able to beat the record (think Wikipedia meets Strava). In 2018, with the help of Jeff Schuler, another co-founder and web developer, the site changed over to what is now the present-day site where each FKT has separate categories and gender times as well as the ability to sort by route and athlete. Pretty snazzy!<\/p>",

I had no idea what FKT was so I just played it cool and later looked up what the heck FKTs were and what the Georgia Loop was. In my defense I had just started trail running so everything was so foreign to me. Fast forward a couple months, Ben started following me on Strava and Instagram and I couldn't believe it. Why would \"THE BEN MERCER\" follow a newb like me. So I totally did what any fan girl would do and comment on his runs and stories to start some kind of dialog in the dorkiest way possible which winded up with me asking to go on a run with him. Needless to say the run went well and we have been happily married for a year in which I set the Georgia Loop FKT and the Georgia Appalachian Trail Section with Ben by my side. I am so grateful for FKTs to bring the man of my dreams into my life and hope that others find love too.<\/p>",

I’m unapologetically enthusiastic about the things I enjoy. I get jump-up-and-down excited easily and I love things fully. Everyone deserves that kind of unhindered joy. It makes life grand. I’m here to talk about one sector of geekiness that is very close to my heart; gaming.<\/p>\n<p><b>My Childhood Best Friend, Pikachu<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I’ve never been great at socializing and I don’t typically give a good first impression. At first glance I’ve been described as awkward, hard to read, and overly enthusiastic. I’m not good in social situations and for most of my life I couldn’t understand why. I’ve spent a portion of my life feeling very broken and lonely. Last year I finally received an autism diagnosis and it’s really helped me understand myself. I’m so relieved to have an autism diagnosis. When I look back on my life as a gamer and human so many blank spaces are now filled. There has always been an intense disconnect between me and other people. But I’ve always had one thing I truly connected with — Pokémon.<\/p>\n<p>My young life changed between 1996 and 1998 when Nintendo released Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Snap for the N64. I was no longer alone in the world. I finally had something to love and connect with. At eleven-years-old I would run off the school bus and power up the N64 as quickly as I could. I even recorded my battles and snap adventures on old VHS tapes so I could rewatch them. My heart would fill up with joy and excitement as I would play.<\/p>\n<p>Childhood wasn’t easy for me; I was a lonely kid and was bullied a lot. I even transferred schools in an attempt to escape the bullying. But wherever I ended up my Pokémon went with me.<\/p>",

I treated that little machine like it was Excalibur. I bought a Nintendo DS and played every single game I could afford. To my surprise, I made friends with other gamers and I was miraculously introduced to the Wii and PlayStation. I seized every opportunity to play every game I could.<\/p>\n<p>When I met my spouse in college we bonded over gaming. We both had many of the same childhood favorites and we shared a true love and respect for gaming. Now we are homeowners and we jump at the chance to get every console and game we can. We game together often and it makes our marriage strong. Recently we’ve been playing Diablo III on PlayStation together. It’s spectacularly fun and really helps with our communication skills. We also play Pokémon Go together on date nights. We actually fought together in a Pokémon Go raid today, we won and both caught a Snorlax, it was awesome!<\/p>\n<p><b>Gaming Female<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Women in the gaming community aren’t always met with open arms. When I say I’m a gamer I’m often challenged with a series of slightly condescending test questions. It’s like a gatekeeper suddenly appears from beneath a bridge and requires me to answer their riddles three. It sometimes makes me hesitant to say I’m a gamer. I love gaming, so why should I have to constantly defend my status as a gamer?<\/p>\n<p>Luckily this isn’t always the case, there are tons of amazing people in the gaming community who welcome everyone with open arms. I don’t typically like talking about gatekeeping. I’m an overwhelmingly positive person and I want to bring attention to the inclusive and fun aspects of gaming. I’m mentioning gatekeeping for one important reason; because I don’t want you to stop gaming because of gatekeepers. There are so many amazing gamers out there, so if you are new to gaming please don’t let the riddles three stop you!<\/p>\n<p>Everyone has an idea of what a gamer is. I have my own idea, to me there is no prerequisite and only one simple requirement; that you enjoy playing games.<\/p>\n<p>I am a gamer. Gaming is sewn into the fabric of my life. And I’m grateful for it.<\/p>\n<p><b>Gaming and Mental Health: An Escape from Isolation<\/b><\/p>\n<p>During 2020 people all over the world were in isolation and\/or quarantine. For me, being socially isolated is commonplace. Mental illness often causes me to isolate myself for days, weeks, or even months. I guess you could say I’m a time-tested expert when it comes to coping with isolation. Sometimes the isolation can be debilitating. It’s easy to get stuck in a spiral of loneliness and lose your sense of self-worth. Gaming sincerely helps with this, especially during the global pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>Gaming can offer connectivity with other people that I wouldn’t have access to otherwise. Before the pandemic I had never played an Animal Crossing game. But during the pandemic Animal Crossing: New Horizons quickly became a 2020 staple. In real life I live on a farm pretty far away from everything, I look out my window and I just see farmland. My spouse is a doctor who worked constantly during the pandemic, so this left me at home completely alone… but I had social connectivity thanks to Animal Crossing.<\/p>\n<p>Animal Crossing opened a bifrost of socialization between me and people all over the world. From my farm in Kentucky (USA) I made friends with people in Germany, Great Britain, and ironically I made one friend who lives seven minutes from me who I probably wouldn’t have met otherwise. Thanks to gaming, we created a community of isolated people who weren’t alone. I even got to play Animal Crossing with Gail Simone, a comic book writer that I absolutely love. It was spectacular.<\/p>",

The podcast hosts admire a bunch of bizarre but amazing sea creatures, like the dumbo octopus, frilled shark, and seadevil anglerfish. However, the fun ends when two unidentifiable creatures clasp the back of Stephen and Shaun’s heads, stab strange appendages into their skulls, and usurp control of their brains. As Stephen and Shaun’s helpless subconscious selves scream in agony, these diabolical creatures...wait a second...that isn’t season 3, episode 13 of CULTURE goodr! That’s a dream this copywriter had last night! Whoops-a-daisy. Let’s try this again.\n  <br><br>\nIn season 3, episode 13 of CULTURE goodr, Stephen and Shaun do a deep dive into goodr’s finance team, also known as Scrooge McDuck’s Bastards. Since we own our own company, we can do whatever the flock we want. (Like waste your time with the opening paragraph of every goodrTIMES CULTURE goodr recap, YOU’RE WELCOME.) But the downside is, we don't have deep pockets from investors. That’s why cashflow is king. When you put consistent attention on making more money and spending less money, it leaves a ton of resources leftover to invest in community and culture. \n <br><br>\nLauren, the Flock Leader of Scrooge McDuck’s Bastards, and a successful procreator of twins, joins the pod to talk about finance. But first, she shares a little about herself: She prefers free time to money, beach day to amusement park day, and pop music to indie. Her spirit animal is a lion because they are beautifully intimidating and protective. Before goodr, she worked for large public companies doing financial analysis, which is boring af, so let’s move on, shall we? Lauren’s a runner. She found goodr. You get it.\n<\/p>\n<div id=\"buzzsprout-player-9008906\"><\/div>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/www.buzzsprout.com\/1056625\/9008906-s03e13-finance-team-the-clouds-in-goodr-s-ecosystem-making-it-rain-or-shine.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-9008906&player=small\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>",

It’s critical to the company’s success. She also has the pleasure of working with all the other flock leaders to manage budgets and make sure that they understand the financials.\n  <br><br>\nAt a high level, Scrooge McDuck’s Bastards collects money and acts as the liaison for all the flocks so they can spend that money. They make sure the company remains profitable so we can continue to invest in fun things. Their flock values are financial stability and curiosity. They see how all the flocks impact our bottom line, and make sure we’re not operating in a volatile environment. If they see a potential red flag, they speak up. Plus they look into the future to see how today's decisions impact tomorrow.\n <br><br>\nFinance’s areas of focus are cashflow, accounting, strategic planning, risk management, and collaboration with other flocks. The most important consideration is making sure we have enough working capital to sustain our business. The secondary focus is making sure flock leaders understand the finances. It’s important for multiple people to look at every transaction. At goodr, we project revenue 12 months in advance. We buy an amount of product for that revenue six months in advance. We need enough cash to support all that, plus salaries, advertising, and happy hours. Lauren says she can reasonably project cashflow “just about three months [in advance] with any accuracy.” (It is unclear why she doesn’t quit her job, buy tarot cards, and become a psychic.)\n<\/p>",

(Can you handle the excitement?!?!?!?!?!) Currently, they accommodate everyone's desire to use Google Sheets, but it's limiting. According to Lauren, goodr likes to spend money on culture the most. The most goodry purchases are the claw machine for the Boston Marathon, the tiki hut event booth, the laser etching machine, and the new Cabana on Abbot Kinney. goodr also gives employees six pairs of sunglasses a month and expenses ride shares for employees so they don’t drive home drunk. (Basically, other companies treat employees like trash, and goodr is the opposite. WOO!)\n  <br><br>\nIn closing, Lauren offers three cheat codes for anyone in the finance space:  <br><br>\n<strong>1)<\/strong> Get a variety of experiences. \n <br><br>\n<strong>2)<\/strong> Have a working knowledge of Excel.  <br><br>\n<strong>3)<\/strong> Be willing to ask tough questions.

I knew at this juncture, “coming back” to try and compete amongst the open division was a highly unlikely reality. I know the up and coming, hungry young athletes and I know the demands of motherhood. Realistically I couldn’t see myself being able to train enough to contend with the young and hungry talent that is able to prioritize training first. My husband and I knew we wanted a family but we wanted to ensure I got everything out of my CrossFit career as possible. I wanted to leave no room for “coulda, shoulda, woulda” or any resentment of a career ended too soon, especially toward any children we might have. I weighed the pros and cons a few times, but more or less, I just had a feeling in my gut that God would help us decide. I was at peace with what I had achieved in my career and was ready to look toward building upon that success into a new chapter.",

              "text": "Another factor in this decision was the prevalence of fertility struggles I saw all around me. We were not naive to the fact that some parents wait a long time to be able to hold a baby in their arms, so pressing that timeline was not a game we wanted to play if that happened to be our situation. But luckily, God had other plans for us.\n\nWe were blessed to get pregnant right away- letting Jesus take the wheel was absolutely the right move because he said “YES! NOW IS THE TIME!” and we were pregnant within weeks from my last event at the Games. <p><\/p><p>\n\nThrough pregnancy I was able to maintain my fitness and because I truly LOVE working out so much, it was easy to want to do...even when I had a big ol belly! I worked out up until the day I left to get induced at 40 weeks and 6 days; I even did an “AMRAP” in the hospital to try and get baby boy moving (walking the halls, bouncing on the labor ball, air squats, yup, it’s true.) \nComing back from childbirth is nothing to rush. READ THAT AGAIN, MOMMAS! Too quickly and you can find yourself with issues that set you back long term, even further down the road. Personally, I took 2 weeks completely off besides walking and breathing exercises. Started slowly adding things in every couple weeks, a new movement; intensity stayed low for a solid 6-8 weeks. Around 3 months I was able to push intensity and lift some heavier weight. I worked with an amazing DPT who specializes in women's health; she was an integral part of my recovery! By 6 months postpartum I was officially  able to do everything safely and soundly! \nDuring this return to fitness my training sessions look very different than before. Five hours a day is now 60-90 minutes. Some weeks I take an extra rest day and swap a nap for a workout. Some days I’m too tired to “hurt,” so I do some light biking or rowing and burpees, just to get blood flowing and a little sweat. I have done more affiliate classes in the last 6 months than I have since 2013 and it is SO much FUN! My priority is to move and to feel good moving my body; I still like to push myself and always will, but it’s for ME, no one else. I don’t have anything to prove to anyone anymore.<\/p><p><\/p>",

              "text": "<p>On season 3, episode 14 of CULTURE goodr, Stephen and Shaun climb to the top of Mt. Doom, but Stephen refuses to throw the One Ring into the lava so it can be unmade. Instead, Stephen claims the One Ring for himself, because it is his precious. However,, Dreams Chief Orchestrator Keri Blunt pops out of f***ing nowhere, leaps onto SDL’s back, and BITES his finger to reclaim the One Ring!!!!  Ohhhhhh no. This isn’t s3e14 of CULTURE goodr! This is just a dream this copywriter had last night. Let’s try again. \n  <br><br>\nOn s3e14 of CULTURE goodr, Stephen and Shaun do a deep dive on the RUN goodr vertical. We launched goodr in 2015 as a run brand. In 2018, we launched BEAST goodr  (for fitness enthusiasts). In 2019, we launched BIKE goodr and GOLF goodr (for...this is obvious). In 2020, we launched GAME goodr (for gamers, specifically video game enthusiasts, but if board game enthusiasts want to join, ok, that’s cool). In 2021, we launched RUN goodr, so we have a vertical specifically dedicated to runners. (Each vertical has its Instagram and social media accounts.) Our overarching main account -- @goodr -- encompasses ALL the verticals. Basically, goodr is Satan and RUN, BEAST, BIKE, GOLF & GAME are Satan’s spawn. (Ditto CULTURE goodr and CABANA goodr.)\n <br><br>\nHan, the community manager for RUN goodr, joins the pod to talk about running (HA) the RUN goodr vertical. In the lightning round, Han -- or, as she stylizes it on Asana, HAN! -- shares a little about herself. She’s from Massachusetts, which makes her a Masshole driver, about a 6 out of 10. (Good thing she can run.) Han thinks Taylor Swift is incredible and wants to retire at age 60. Before goodr, she went to American University in Washington D.C., which sounds made-up, so she’s probably a Russian spy. Let’s take a look at her cat hair-covered resume: She interned at Animal Planet and The Science Channel, plus worked at a PR agency, probably doing PR for rats. Rats could use a publicist. Everyone hates them. Anyway, Han is a lifelong runner, so she gravitated to goodr. Now she’s part of our cult for life. NOBODY LEAVES, HAN. NOBODY LEAVES.\n<\/p>\n<div id=\"buzzsprout-player-9082796\"><\/div>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/www.buzzsprout.com\/1056625\/9082796-s03e14-run-community-manager-helping-to-create-the-ideal-microbial-environment-in-goodr-s-ecocsystem.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-9082796&player=small\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>",

Her role is fostering community connection amongst fans and customers, making sure we're speaking directly to runners, and creating hype for RUN goodr\/all things goodr. No day is really the same. Han posts on RUN goodr, responds to DMs and comments, talks to athletes and agents for sponsorships (like Alexi Pappas), interacts with the Flamboyance (the goodr ambassador program), plans giveaways, talks to other brands for potential partnerships (like Garmin Fitness, Territory Run Co & Sarah Murray Design Studio), and works for the internal goodr team for designed copy content to put on social channels.\n <br><br>\nHan, Shaun and Stephen go on to discuss life as a community manager, favorite posts on RUN goodr, the value of inclusivity, the quirks of running, and what it’s like working for goodr. Check out the podcast episode to learn everything about RUN goodr. It’s more convenient than reading. For real.

We want ALL runners to feel included in the RUN goodr community. <br><br>\n\n<strong>2)<\/strong> “Runners like to keep it real.” We have to be able to relate to runners and talk to them about topics that they want to talk about. “So for example, anytime we mentioned any sort of bodily function on RUN goodr’s copy we get everyone's life story about every bodily function they have ever had.” WOO!!! POOP STORIES!!! <br><br>\n\n<strong>3)<\/strong> “Making connections.” Han says, “The run world isn't huge in general. So the more people you can talk to, the better.”\n  <br><br>\n\nThat’s it for this week. Remember: If you lose a toenail while running, mail it to Han.

He has his hands (and beard) in everything BIKE goodr, like social posts, product launches, campaigns, partnerships, athletes (Ashton Lambie), the Flamboyance (goodr ambassador program), etc. (Doug’s also a HILARIOUS copywriter, and always crushes it in Copypaloozas, events where the goodr copy team and other creative flamingos gather to crank out IG Feed posts and read them aloud.) Specifically, Doug manages social media, monitoring comments, responding to people, scheduling content, connecting with potential partners\/events, and coming up with even more ridiculous stuff to top what goodr did the day\/week\/month\/year before.\n <br><br>\nThe vertical campaign for BIKE goodr is called “You ride you.” Doug explains that cycling has a stuffy, elitist reputation, but more and more people are getting into cycling, especially since the pandemic hit. Cycling can be a really intimidating sport to get into. There's a lot of unspoken rules. People can be judgmental and gatekeep. It’s lame. Doug encourages everyone to ride, and just be yourself, without worrying about the rules. If you’re riding a bike and having fun, you’re doing it right. It doesn't matter how expensive your ride is. It doesn't matter if your kit matches every piece of equipment. It doesn't matter if you're on a commuter bike, a road bike, a mountain bike or a gravel bike. You ride you. (NOT “ewe ride ewe”. It’s cruel to stack female sheep. Don’t do it!)\n<\/p>",

(Never underestimate the importance of a killer mustache.) If you want all the juicy details, listen to the podcast! Perhaps while riding a bike.\n <br><br>\nIn closing, Doug offers three cheat codes for anyone in the bike space:  <br><br>\n\n<strong>1)<\/strong> “Authenticity, you just be yourself.” As we say at goodr, if your goal is to be authentic and people don't like you, it's okay. If the goal is to be liked, and people don't like you, you're fucked.  <br><br>\n\n<strong>2) <\/strong>“Just show up, show up to rides, show up to the bike shop, tip your bike mechanics...talk to them, ask them questions. Be curious.”   <br><br>\n\n<strong>3)<\/strong> “Get into gravel. It's so fun. It's a blast.” \n  <br><br>\nSee you next week! Remember, you ride you.

              "text": "<p>In season 3, episode 16 of CULTURE goodr, Stephen and Shaun broadcast live from a boat off the coast of Amity Island. However, a piercing scream interrupts their banter. They look at the ocean, and see goodr copywriter\/prop-mistress Tofutti getting attacked by a great white shark. “SH-SH-SH-SHARK!” cries Tofutti, as her blood stains the water. “OWWWIEEEE!!” “Hey!” says SDL. “You’re not dying on my watch!” “Nor mine!” says Shaun. “Heck yeah!” The hosts jump into the ocean and punch the shark in the f***ing  face until it lets Tofutti go. Luckily, she only lost a leg and an arm, so she can easily be made into a cyborg by the mad scientists at Stephen’s secret mad lab- ohhhh no. This is all totally true but we have to keep it top secret. So, whoopsie!!! Let’s try this again.\n <br><br>\nIn season 3, episode 16 of CULTURE goodr, Stephen and Shaun do a deep dive into GOLF goodr. Taylor, the Master of Flamingos, aka GOLF goodr Community Manager, joins the pod to talk about his vertical. For you non-golfers out there, “par” is the number of strokes an expert player is expected to make for each hole. If you score one under par, that’s a “birdie.” If you score two under par, that’s an “eagle.” If you score three under par, that’s an “albatross.” Notice the bird theme? However, if you score one OVER par, that’s a “bogey.” Nobody knows why they call it a “bogey.” (Boogers? The bogey-man?) Stephen thinks it’s because the Golf Gods want you to feel bad. But that’s a really good score for an amateur! Thus, GOLF goodr created the campaign, “It’s not a bogey, it’s a flamingo!” It fits the avian theme, and ‘flamingo’ sounds WAY better than ‘bogey.’ At GOLF goodr, we want to celebrate all of you flamingo golfers out there.

He also likes sliding into athletes’ DMs if he thinks they’re a good fit for the brand. Recently he really enjoyed working with Annie Park, a young LPGA athlete, who the GOLF goodr community LOVES. Taylor adds that his favorite partnership so far is with Palm Golf Co. But his dream partnership? To collaborate with his namesake, TailorMade, on a Flamingo-themed SIM driver!!! (Obvs.)\n  <br><br>\nTaylor goes on in more detail to discuss golf, his role, and his Purpose Project, working with Youth On Course to make golf more accessible. SO STOP READING THIS TRASH AND GO LISTEN! In closing, Taylor shares three cheat codes for those in the golf space:  <br><br>\n<strong>1) <\/strong>Don’t be afraid of a ‘no.’  <br><br>\n<strong>2) <\/strong>What you like is what the people like as well . <br><br>\n<strong>3) <\/strong>Anything you put on is going to cook.\n <br><br>\nGotta go -- Cyborg Tofutti just arrived at The Lagoon and rumor has it her robot arm and robot leg can shoot lasers and stuff.

Besides being a lover of junk food (or holy food as she calls it), and being a huge music and cat lover, she’s obsessed with gaming. We love her around here because she’s an all-around freaking badass who sticks to her guns, but who is at the same time open-minded and always willing to try new things. She loves being the GAME community manager because she loves to talk about gaming. She loves to focus on outside partnerships, respond to comments on social media, and talk about different games. Ah, if only there were more hours in the day for actual gaming!!! *sigh*\n <br><br>\nTheresa basically has her paws on essentially everything involving GAME. This includes social partnerships, activations, slinging sunglasses and blue light blockers, and bringing the FUN to the gaming community. We've had other brands in the game space actually tell us our approach is what the gaming community needs because we're not this stuffy company that's doing the same stuff over and over again. Partners know they can trust us to bring it. Every day is an opportunity to do something special. We always want to give back to our consumers and do fun things to show that we appreciate them. Theresa thinks that's one thing that really speaks volumes about goodr and its consumers. When we created GAME goodr we wanted to touch on this audience that was being underserved because gamers are so much more than the stigma of people who just sit in front of video games all day.\n<\/p>",

              "text": "<p>In Season 3, Episode 17 of CULTURE goodr, after having a spooooky dream where he is attacked by a Frankenstein monster, Doogie goes to a psychiatrist and realizes that he is missing out on life because of his job. Wait a second, that is Season 2 Episode 1 of Doogie Howser, M.D. (aptly called Doogenstein). We wonder if Stephen or Shaun has ever dreamed that they were being attacked by a Doogenstein monster?! Oops, we did it again. This was totally not related to the CULTURE goodr Podcast. Do you think a doctor could help us figure out why our copywriters keep making these bizarre mistakes?! Or do you think they’re deliberately doing it just to be punks?! \n <br><br>\nIn season 3, episode 17 of CULTURE goodr, Stephen and Shaun hulk out while exploring our BEAST vertical. BEAST goodr was our second vertical which we launched after RUN. So, you may be wondering: What’s a BEAST?! They’re our CrossFitters, weightlifters, and OCR athletes!!! Just like our RUN community, our BEAST athletes are community-driven and love to have fun. When goodr created the BEAST vertical, we didn’t anticipate the lack of small retailers in the CrossFit, OCR, and weightlifting space here in the U.S. So we had to shift our model from how we approached RUN. We started investing and going to major events like WOD-A-Palooza and the CrossFit world championships. In this episode, Stephen and Shaun chat with Stephany, our Beast Wrangler, aka our Beast Community Manager. As you can imagine she has been instrumental in growing this vertical and community here at goodr!!!\n<\/p>\n<div id=\"buzzsprout-player-9197490\"><\/div>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/www.buzzsprout.com\/1056625\/9197490-s03e17-beast-community-manager-wrangling-beast-communities-to-support-connection-in-goodr-s-ecosystem.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-9197490&player=small\" type=\"text\/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>",

Worst hotel ever!!!\n<br><br>\nA little backstory… I was looking for a luxury room for a couple of days while I was in Transylvania for a swingers convention. I wanted to have a quiet place to escape to just in case I wasn’t vibing with anyone. You just never know who or what you’re going to encounter at these things. Unfortunately, the convention turned out to be a playground equipment expo as in SWINGS, not swingers. They were not pleased to have a middle-aged, pansexual, klepto flamingo hanging around, so I ended up spending way more time at the hotel than I had originally planned. \n<br><br>\nThis place was completely run down, filthy, and basically vermin central. There were cobwebs EVERYWHERE. Rats were scurrying down the hallways. I almost broke my neck on the stairs when I slipped on a pile of bat guano. The bats just drop their business wherever they please. The staff doesn’t even bother to clean it up… or anything else for that matter. \n<br><br>\nMy room was totally unacceptable!!! The tattered bedspread released a poof of dust when I plopped my suitcase down on it. There were bloodstains on the rug under the bed. You would NOT want to take a blacklight to this place.  \n<br><br>\nI don’t want to sound judgmental, but the flamingo who runs the joint is a kook and gave me the mega creeps. His watery eyes resembled bloody raw egg yolks. His gray feathers appeared moth-eaten and patchy, with sallow goose-pimpled skin peeking out through the bald patches. He wore a strange wig resembling the lead singer’s hair from a Flock of Seagulls. I thought it was kind of weird that he asked me my blood type at check-in, but he said it was hotel policy in case of an emergency. I swear when I told him “O positive,” he did a chef’s kiss. <br><br>\n<\/p>",
